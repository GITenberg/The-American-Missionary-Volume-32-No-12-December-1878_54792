<h3>ABSTRACT OF THE THIRTY-SECOND REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE A. M. A.</h3>


<p>The Report opens with an expression of thanks to God for the general prosperity of
its work, obituary notices of the Rev. Silas McKeen, D. D., of Bradford, Vt., a Vice-President,
and <a name="Err_2" id="Err_2"></a>Mrs. Benjamin James, of the Mendi Mission, and a brief review of the
marked progress of the last thirty-two years in the line of its aim and effort.</p>


<h4>The Freedmen.</h4>

<p>The educational work of the Association has been vigorously sustained, with increasing
numbers, and at the cost of great self-denial on the part of both teachers and
pupils. New buildings have been erected for the Emerson Institute at Mobile, Ala.,
for the Lewis High School and Norwich Chapel at Macon, Ga., for the Straight University
at New Orleans, La., and for the Beach Institute at Savannah, Ga., under the
supervision of Prof. T. N. Chase, of Atlanta. They are simple but commodious, and
admirably adapted for their uses, better located than formerly, and cost no more than
the insurance received for the buildings which they replace. <a name="Err_3" id="Err_3"></a>The institutions of the
Association are excellently located.</p>

<p>The early educational work was, of necessity, altogether primary. As the States
assumed the support of common schools, the Association gave itself more and more to
Normal teaching, and has always found a demand for more teachers than its schools
could furnish. A few more each year are advancing into the collegiate and professional
courses. Its one Law and three Theological classes have been well sustained, and it has
also co-operated with the Presbytery of Washington in the support of the Theological
Department of Howard University. The practical and moral importance of the Industrial
Departments is also referred to. During the year small amounts have been
added to the salaries of a number of common-school teachers, graduates from its institutions,
enabling them to extend the time of their school-year from three or six to nine
months.</p>

<p>The need of this work is emphasized by the fact that there are still 3,500,000
over ten years of age in the South who cannot read, over 1,135,000 of whom are legal
voters. The need of permanent endowments and of student aid are also dwelt upon. A
depiction of the influence of these institutions in the homes, the common schools, the
churches, and upon the sentiment of the people of the South, and especially of the positiveness
of their religious influence, concludes this part of the Report.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>
<p>The report of church work adds five new churches organized during the year to its
list. Judged by the measure of accessions to membership by profession of faith, these
sixty-four churches have not been dead nor fruitless. Fifteen of them report from eleven
to fifty such additions each, making an average of over twenty-four, and amounting to 368
in all. Indications of growth are also found in increased efforts for self-support and for
systematic giving. The Sunday-schools of the churches not only are well sustained, but
the teachers go out into churches of other orders, and into mission work, thus reaching
many thousands of youth and children.</p>

<p>The cause of temperance has been advancing in these churches. The six local conferences
have, by their annual meetings, shown progress and done good. The difficulties
of a rapid extension of church work in the South are referred to, and the hope expressed,
of surmounting such of them as may be overcome under the field-superintendence
of Rev. Dr. Roy, who will very soon be in his headquarters at Atlanta.</p>

<p>In summing up the work among the Freedmen, encouragement is drawn from the
fact that some of the best pastors and teachers now in the field were taken from the
streets by the missionary teachers of the Association, and have developed under its care
to be its fellow-helpers; also, that results appear to be more permanent and substantial.</p>


<h4>Africa.</h4>

<p>Four missionaries were sent, Feb. 8, to the reinforcement of the five who sailed the
September before. The outlook was discouraging in both its material and spiritual aspects.
But they went to work practically and hopefully, and have labored with good
success. Twenty-two new members have been received into the church at Good Hope.
Preaching services and Sunday and day-schools have also been opened at Avery and
Debia.</p>

<p>The missionaries desire increased facilities for taking the children into their homes
under their constant care, a work which they have begun already. The industrial work
at Avery has been revived. These missionary families, numbering fifteen souls in all,
have endured the trying climate, and that through its sickly season, as well as could
have been hoped. All of them have been sick; one of their number has died; none of
them are in impaired health, so far as can be learned.</p>

<p>The report speaks of the intention to strengthen this mission as it may seem to demand,
of the need of means with which to do it, and of the missionary interest awakened
in the South, and especially at Hampton and Fisk.</p>


<h4>The Indians.</h4>

<p>The necessity of changing agents has made much unexpected work, and the difficulties
of supplying their places are referred to. The work of Rev. Mr. Eells at S’Kokomish
is spoken of. The Indians show increasing interest in education, but the unsettled condition
of their affairs prevents the best success. The recommendations made by the
representatives of the various religious denominations to the Board of Commissioners
are recited. The possibility of a transfer of the Indians to the War Department is
alluded to, and deprecated as a long step in retreat.</p>


<h4>The Chinese in America.</h4>

<p>The outcries against the Chinaman, and the abuse he receives on every hand, are
alluded to as having had already an influence in diminishing the number of those coming
to our shores.</p>

<p>The Association has sustained eleven schools during the year, with 1,492 pupils.
The Chinese Congregational Association and the Bethany Home have been kept up, with
increasing usefulness. Seventy-five have been hopefully converted during the year.
The indebtedness of the Association to Rev. Wm. C. Pond, its superintendent in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
work, is heartily acknowledged. The desire of the Chinese converts for the conversion
of their own people in their native land is referred to as a convincing proof that they
have entered into the spirit of the Master. The new Chinese embassy to this country
is spoken of as full of promise in regard to all the questions affecting that race.</p>


<h4>Finances.</h4>

<p>The receipts of the year have been $195,601.65; the expenses have been $188,079.46,
leaving a balance of $7,522.19. The current receipts are not equal by $13,063.23 to
those of the preceding year, the falling off being mainly in legacies; and the $17,904.92
in cash (and $6,950 in pledges) for the debt may have somewhat lessened the regular
gifts.</p>

<p>The debt, two years ago, was $93,000; one year ago it was $63,000; what has
been received and saved for it together this year amounts to $25,427.11, which has reduced
it to $37,389.79, and pledges are held for $6,950, which, when redeemed, will further
diminish it to $30,439.79.</p>

<p>The Committee recognize the hand of the Lord, and the hearts of His people in this
good showing. The Report makes special mention of the gifts from the field for this
object, and yet the remaining debt is deeply deplored as preventing the enlargement of
the work. The careful and wise use of the funds in its hands encourages the Association
to ask for the removal of this its last hindrance.</p>


<h4>Sundries.</h4>

<p>References to the co-operation of the Freedmen’s Missions Aid Society in England,
the return of the Jubilee Singers, the changes successfully made in the form and
editing of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY, and the generous aid of the American Bible
Society, conclude the Report.</p>

<p>Rev. Ebenezer Cutler, D. D., of Worcester, read a paper upon “The Revival
of Righteousness in the Prosecution of Christian Work among the Despised
Races of America,” which was referred to a committee.</p>

<p>Hon. Amos C. Barstow, of Providence, R. I., read the report of the committee
on the Indians as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Committee to whom was referred so much of the Annual Report as relates to
the work of the Association among the Indians, are glad to be able to approve the
action of the Executive Committee for the past year, both with respect to its missions
and its agencies. They beg also to indorse and emphasize the sentiment—twice repeated
in the Report—that “the unsettled condition of the Indians, growing out of
their frequent and enforced removal, sometimes for long distances, and at short notice,
continues to rob the efforts put forth in their behalf of much of their rightful success.”</p>

<p>Like the dove sent out from the Ark, the Indian has found no rest for the sole of
his foot. Of the 275,000 Indians in what is now our country, fifty years ago 130,000
were east of the Mississippi River, where now but 25,000 remain.</p>

<p>At first we were content to crowd them beyond the Mississippi, but our example at
the East has proved contagious among the settlers of the new States west of the Mississippi,
and now all these States, by their influence over the General Government, are
emptying their Indians into the Territories. The Pawnees and Poncas, and the great
bands of Sioux Indians, under those famous chiefs Red Cloud and Spotted Tail—in all
15,000—have been pushed out of Nebraska within two years. The great States of
Iowa and Kansas have but 1,000 each remaining in their borders, and Missouri has
none. At the present moment, Colorado is making an effort to push the 3,200 Ute

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>

Indians, who have always lived upon her soil, either beyond her borders or up into the
mountains, 7,000 feet above the sea level, and far above the possibility of self-support.</p>

<p>The Stockbridge Indians, whose original home was amid the beautiful valleys of old
Berkshire, in Massachusetts, and who, while there—130 years ago—enjoyed the stated
ministry of David Brainard, and afterwards of Jonathan Edwards, were moved west as
far as the State of New York, ninety years ago. Since then they have been moved five
times, and now a remnant of the tribe occupy a little reservation in Northern Wisconsin.
Why should they have been exposed to such perils as haunt a people, thus violently
and repeatedly torn up by the roots, and compelled to make new homes far distant
from the graves of their sires? Or, rather, civilized and Christianized as they are
and were, why should they not long ago have come to individual homestead rights of
portions of their land in fee, <em>with citizenship</em>, as do multitudes of foreigners, of far
less education? Instead of girding the Indians about with bands of love, and holding
them to their ancient homes, where they could be easily reached by Gospel influences,
the nation has taken it for granted that the “wilderness and solitary place” was the
only fit home for them; and therefore, in the expressive language of Red Cloud, has
“kept them on wheels.” We have been crowding them before the ever-increasing
column of our Western emigration, and even now, the hand of the nation does not
spare, neither does its heart relent. The Santee and other bands of Indians, fully civilized,
are now petitioners for the right to take up homesteads that shall cover the present
allotments, already cultivated and improved by them. Their petition is indorsed by
the Indian Bureau and Interior Department, and though urged upon Congress last winter
by all the added influence of the Board of Indian Commissioners, nothing was
done. Congress has always shown more willingness to <em>feed</em> the Indians than to <em>locate</em>
them. To secure progress in civilization, we must locate them—give them permanent
homes, with all the motives for industry which they will inspire. To herd and feed
them from the public crib permanently, like cattle, is to degrade and pauperize them,
rather than to civilize and bring them to self-support.</p>

<p>There is a feeling quite too common in the community, that Indians, after all, are
only <em>outlaws</em>, <em>Ishmaelites</em>, <em>savages</em>, “having no rights which white men are bound
to respect,” and no elements of character which encourage efforts for their improvement.</p>

<p>A popular encyclopædia affirms that, “as a race, the animal propensities in the
Indian strongly preponderate over the intellectual, and render their civilization, even
with the help of education and Christianity, an event <em>hardly to be hoped for</em>.” Neither
the experience of Christian philanthropists, nor the facts of history, will justify this
sweeping assertion.</p>

<p>We do not claim that they have taken on them the nature of angels. We only
claim that they are <span class="smcap">men</span>, and that our Divine Master made no mistake in giving His
Gospel to enlighten them, His blood to redeem them, or His command to us to publish
that Gospel to them. If Eliot and Brainard and Edwards found encouragement for
Christian efforts in their behalf, why may not the Christians of this generation labor
for them with hope? Are we wiser or better than they? Or are the Indians worse
and their condition more hopeless, than in the days of our fathers?</p>

<p>It is safe to affirm, in spite of all the obstacles in their path, that, under the efforts
put forth in their behalf, many of the Indian tribes are making commendable progress
in civilization, and large numbers of them are bringing forth in their lives the peaceable
fruits of righteousness.</p>

<p>We, therefore, recommend not only that the Association continue its work for the
evangelization of the Indians, but that it enlarge and extend it, as fast as God in His
providence may open the way.</p>

The report was accepted, and the following resolution, appended thereto, was

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That, as God raised up His ancient people, and made them the repository
of the truth, to prepare the way for the advent of the Saviour, when the fullness of
time should come, so He has raised up this nation to carry forward that truth to its
final consummation, and that it becometh us to put forth every possible effort for
accomplishing this work, in humble reliance upon the direct agency of the Holy Spirit,
believing that God will bless well-directed, earnest Christian effort, energize and apply
the truth by the personal presence and power of a living Christ; and that we regard
the American Missionary Association as one of the most direct and efficient agencies
for securing this end, and would press its claim upon our churches for an increase in
benevolent contributions, that its work may be enlarged and prosecuted with increased
vigor.</p></div>

by Rev. Stacy Fowler.</p>

<p>Rev. Daniel T. Fiske, D. D., read the report of the committee on the paper
presented by Secretary Strieby.</p>

<p>Hon. Edmund D. Sawyer gave the report of the committee on Finance as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee appointed to consider and examine the Financial statement of the
American Missionary Association, covering the receipts and expenditures for the year
ending September 30th, 1878, respectfully submit the following Report:</p>

<p>The receipts from all sources have been $195,601.65, or about thirteen thousand
dollars less than for the preceding year. The expenses, including amounts paid for
church and educational work, publications, cost of collecting funds and cost of administration,
have been $167,728.23. There is due the Tillotson Normal and Collegiate
Institute $2,446.31, and there has been paid towards cancelling the debt $25,427.11.
Of the amount paid upon the debt, the sum of $17,904.92 was contributed directly for
the purpose, and $7,522.19 has been saved from the income of the year. Your Committee
are happy to testify, that the administration of the affairs of the Association
appears to have been conducted with wisdom, ability and faithfulness. While the
work for the year has not been curtailed, the receipts have been less. Yet from them
quite a sum has been saved towards cancelling the indebtedness. It is greatly to be
regretted, that the receipts during the year have not been sufficient to pay in full the
debt, as there still remains unpaid, and unprovided for, the sum of $30,439.79. Certainly
it would seem that our churches could easily contribute this sum, which, if done,
would give your Executive Committee new courage to plan for the extension of work
now so well established and wisely conducted.</p>

<p>Your Committee would suggest that an effort be made to extend the paying circulation
of the monthly publication, the “<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>,” which is now so attractive
and desirable, communicating as it does, information relating to the operations
and needs of the Association, and the progress made in the different fields of its occupation.
The administrative expenses seem to us small, compared with the magnitude
and importance of the work accomplished, giving evidence that this department is conducted
with great economy, and most conscientious fidelity.</p>

<p>When we consider the nature and extent of the work committed to the care of this
organization, and that the appeal comes to us as a Christian duty, to help educate and
Christianize these millions of our own citizens, now living in a condition of ignorance
and degradation, we are forced to the conclusion, that our churches do not realize
sufficiently, either their obligation or privilege, to meet the call with liberal and glad
contributions.</p>

<p>The annual receipts of this Association, engaged in Christian work second in importance
of no other, ought to be greatly increased. May we not ask the Pastors of
our churches, to bring to the attention of their congregations, the necessities of those
for whom this Association is laboring; and we urge individual Christians to such faithful
labor and consecration as will extend a knowledge of the needs and deepen the interest
felt in this great and good work, so that contributions may be largely increased.</p>

<p>From an examination of the various statements submitted, showing in detail the
operations of the Association, and the condition of the property interests it has in
charge, your Committee are prepared to commend it most heartily to the continued
confidence and sympathy of our churches, and to recommend that every effort be
made to secure enlarged receipts, so that the debt shall speedily be paid and the increased
work that so needs to be done can be undertaken.</p>

<p>The report was discussed by Secretary Strieby, District-Secretaries Woodworth,
Pike, and Powell, Hon. E. D. Sawyer, Rev. George F. Stanton, Rev.
Addison P. Foster, Rev. Cyrus W. Wallace, D. D., Hon. Edward S. Tobey,
Rev. Rowland B. Howard, Rev. Albert H. Plumb.</p>

<p>Rev. John S. Ewell led in prayer.</p>

<p>On motion, it was voted “that a committee of three be appointed to present
to the churches the expression of the Association concerning its debt.”
The Rev. George A. Oviatt, Rev. George F. Stanton and Rev. William L.
Gaylord were appointed such committee.</p>

<p>Rev. Heman P. DeForrest read the report of the committee on “Moral
and Religious Education,” as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee, to whom was assigned the topic of “Moral and Religious Education,
especially among the colored women of the South,” offer their Report with a deep conviction
of the central and commanding importance of the work thus indicated. The two
faculties which, in the Freedman, need chief attention, are his intellect and his conscience.
Of these, the moral faculty must take precedence in importance. By the effect
of slavery, and its accompanying influences, acting through many generations, a blight
amounting, in some directions, well-nigh to extinguishment, has fallen upon his moral
sense. His education, under the old system, did not develop this faculty, for it was
only the hard education of rough contact with life and with men, which, indeed, sharpened
his intellect sometimes, but buried conscience yet deeper under the weight of false
teaching and falser custom. His religion did not help him here, for it has been a sensuous
and emotional experience, not deemed inconsistent with the grossest violations of
moral law. It is the work of Associations like this to solemnize, in his behalf, the marriage,
subject to no subsequent divorce, of religion and morality. And it is, we believe,
a happy quality of the genius of Congregationalism, that it will not pour oil upon the
flame of emotional piety, but will chiefly emphasize the spiritual truths and moral laws
which forever underlie all true religion.</p>

<p>But now the question arises, whether, in all our planning and thinking for the Freedman,
too little has not been said and thought by our churches in regard to the Freedwoman.</p>

<p>She, like her brother, has been debased by slavery; debased, moreover, in the very
citadel of her sacred womanhood, until the very instinct on which the sanctity of the
home must rest, if it exist at all, has become almost extirpated.</p>

<p>There can be no elevation of the Freedman that does not rest upon the moral
restoration of the Freedwoman. The position of woman is everywhere the measure
of moral attainment, and here, where she has become the sport and lawful prey of
two races, she more than ever holds the key of the situation.</p>

<p>The feeling, gaining strength through all the experience of our missionaries and teachers
and superintendents, that an effort needs to be made for her benefit distinctly, now
demands expression in the councils of this body.</p>

<p>Your Committee has no new light upon this subject; it has no specific to offer for the
evil which makes so great a demand upon our sympathy. We can only appeal to this
body, and to the churches, whether now, in the spectacle of two and a half millions of
Freedwomen, of whom only a mere fraction are yet under the influence of schools and
pure churches, lifting up their cry, not “from Greenland’s icy mountains, nor India’s
coral strand,” nor whence “Afric’s sunny fountains roll down their golden sand,” but
from the sunny half of these United States of America, we have not a call of God, which
the dullest ear cannot fail to hear. And we, brethren and sisters, are charged with the
duty of responding to this cry, with no uncertain sound.</p>

<p>The Committee feel the responsibility which rests upon them in undertaking to propose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>

new measures, and hesitate to offer too radical suggestions. Yet, they cannot be
deaf to the appeal of this kind of work, or content themselves with vague and general
exhortations. We hail as a good omen, and as an indication of Providence as to the
course to be taken, the fact that already, through the influence of one Christian lady of
the Northwest, a lady missionary, specially instructed to labor among the homes of the
Freedmen, by personal contact, for the moral and religious education of the colored
woman, is now actually at work. Our recommendation is that, following out this beginning,
Christian women of mature experience and wise tact be appointed, to such an
extent as funds will permit, who shall labor for the elevation of the Freedwomen, by
those methods of personal influence which are, of all, most efficient. We believe that in
no other way can we strike so nearly at the root of the ignorance and immorality which,
in behalf of the Freedmen, we contend against.</p>

<p>But, obviously, it would not be right to take the funds appropriated for education or
church extension for this purpose, and thereby curtail a work which needs, on the contrary,
to be at once extended. Whence shall the support of these lady workers come,
then?</p>

<p>We feel constrained, in reply, to appeal to that large and earnest body to whom we are
not wont to appeal in vain—the Christian women of our Northern churches. Suppose that
in each church an appeal should be made to the ladies, already doing much in missionary
work, and sending generous supplies of clothing and other necessaries to the Freedmen,
to assume the responsibility of supporting, either themselves or in conjunction with
neighboring churches, these female workers among the Freedwomen. Could they, would
they resist the appeal of this sister of theirs, upon whom iron despotism has set its mark of
deep degradation, through no fault of hers, and who now lifts up appealing eyes, pleading
to be restored to the sisterhood of the pure and the holy, to whom manhood owes all
that is noblest and highest in its proudest development? We know them better than to
imagine any such refusal. We believe the Christian women of the North, when once this
channel is opened, will see in it their choice opportunity, and respond in a way that shall
set forward our work by a great advance.</p>

<p>And we further offer the suggestion, following again a thought which has been born,
and has already, to a degree, taken form, in the field of labor, that in the principal centres
of the Southern field, local organizations of women may be constituted, which shall have
special charge of this work, and through which the funds raised may be applied to their
purpose.</p>

<p>By this three-fold chain of operations—the appointment of Christian women of mature
character to special labor among the Freedwomen, the organization of local boards of
women at the several centres of operation, and support by the Christian ladies of the
North—it seems to the Committee that this important and too long neglected work may
be simply and effectually accomplished. And, as rapidly as the developments will
allow, we believe the work in the field should be passed into the hands of the elevated
and Christianized Freedwoman herself, who, not only by visitation, but by the example
of her own holy womanhood, and her own Christian home, shall disseminate the forces
of light through all the darkness of the land where she lives.</p>

</div>

<p>Rev. G. S. Pope, of Tougaloo, Miss., spoke upon the topic.</p>

<p>The report of the committee on the “Normal Work of the Association”
was presented by Rev. W. W. Adams, D. D., as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Committee congratulate the Association on the work of the year, as represented
in the Report. It is but seventeen years since the first school for Freedmen was opened,
and but twelve years since the first Normal school was started. Last year 7,229 pupils
were under instruction in the schools of this Association, of whom 1,459 were in Normal
schools. The increase in the number of pupils of all grades last year, over the number
of the year before, was 1,789; in Normal schools the increase was 126; in college and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>

professional schools, 50. The eagerness of the colored people to obtain at least a rudimentary
education has ever been a most encouraging sign. The young man who last
year walked fifty miles with his trunk upon his back that he might enter school, recalls
the zeal of the late Dr. Goodell, of Constantinople, who, in his youth, also walked sixty
miles, with a trunk strapped upon his back, that he might enter the Phillips Academy at
Andover. The demand for teachers from the Normal schools—quite beyond the ability
to supply them—is one of the surest indications that the schools are meeting an urgent
need. But the tendency of some pupils to consider themselves qualified to become
teachers, after obtaining the merest rudiments of knowledge, is earnestly to be deprecated
and discouraged. It needs to be dealt with as an easily besetting sin. The replacing
of the burned buildings by new ones, at a cost within the amounts of insurance
recovered, the better location of some of them, the increasing, and increasingly expressed
sympathy of the better classes of Southern whites with the educational work of
the Association, are also occasions of congratulation. The devotion of a portion of the
time of pupils to manual labor is to be commended on grounds of economy, of industrial
training, of the best and most diversified moral culture.</p>

<p>We very earnestly commend to the friends of the Association the appeal of its officers
for permanent endowments of the higher institutions. The elevation of the colored race
must be in large measure the work of colored men and women. But they must first be
trained for their work in institutions established among them. Without endowment
there is no assurance of permanence in the institutions we have already given them;
without endowment they are not established; the labor of the past is not secured from
total loss in the future. It needs to be distinctly emphasized, also, that the permanent
establishment of educational institutions of a high order is the great work of this Association
among the colored men, and the foundation for all uplifting work beside. The
continuous training of our schools—intellectual, industrial, social and moral training,
all in one—is needed for the development of higher ideals and nobler types of character,
and, we are happy to add, has already resulted in such development in not a few of the
pupils. This training is needed as a counterpoise to the operation, otherwise mischievous
because unbalanced, of some prominent forces of the African temperament; needed to
hold the imagination within the limits of reason and righteousness, to curb emotional
excess, to save life from becoming the sport of changeful impulses. Experience has
proved that the training given changes the type of piety greatly for the better. It is
not less fervent, but it is less exclusively and wildly emotional. It becomes more
rational, more consistent; it has more of principle and character in it; it is more truly
a service of righteousness, more reputable, more effective for good. In order that church
membership may be helpful rather than harmful to righteousness, and that church life
among the Africans may be genuinely Christian, there is urgent need of a worthier
Christian education of the African ministry. It is peculiarly our work to give that education.
The general education provided for through our Normal schools is indispensable,
that the colored people may deserve and command the respect of their white fellow-citizens
at the South; that they may clearly understand their rights as citizens; may
know how to secure them and make wise use of them.</p>

<p>It has been truly said that the work of uplifting the colored race is, from beginning
to end, a long, slow process of education. In that process the Normal schools and higher
institutions of the American Missionary Association have a place second in importance
to no other. We have begun a good work; the question now is, whether we shall do it
or leave it undone through lack of establishing the institutions we have founded.</p>

<h4>Afternoon Session.</h4>

in the chair.</p>

<p>The committee on the debt of the Association, to which Secretary Strieby
was added, presented the following statement and suggestions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The American Missionary Association at its meeting in Taunton, Mass., adopted
the following statement and suggestions respecting its debt:</p>

<p>The debt of this Association has been, and still is, a great hindrance to its progress,
preventing that advance which is so much needed along the whole line of endeavors.
The Association welcomes, with hearty thanks to God, the report of its treasurer,
announcing the still further reduction of the debt, bringing the amount down, if all
pledges are paid, to $25,000. An effort having been made at this meeting to secure
pledges of $25 each, encouraging responses were made, amounting to over $3,000.</p>

<p>In view of these facts it was resolved that an effort be made for the total extinction
of the debt, and the following suggestions are offered as to the methods in which our
friends may aid us:</p>

<p>1. Individuals and households, who are interested in our work, may send pledges
of one or more shares (of $25 each), as their ability and benevolence may suggest, the
more wealthy being asked to remember that if the debt is paid, some of the contributions
must be large and liberal.</p>

<p>2. Pastors may invite their congregations to make such pledges.</p>

<p>3. Pastors may (as some have volunteered at this meeting to do) bring the subject
before the local conferences, and awaken an interest in securing such pledges.</p>

<p>4. The Day of Thanksgiving is near at hand, and a glad offering for this purpose may
be an acceptable gift to the God of all mercies, as well as helpful to the Association.</p>

<p>5. The holiday season, not far distant, may be made the occasion of like offerings.
The Association intrusts to its Executive officers the duty of selecting and carrying out
the best methods for laying these suggestions before the friends of the despised
races of America.</p>
</div>

<p>The report was accepted and adopted.</p>

<p>Rev. Edward Strong, D. D., read the report of the Committee on Church
Extension, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee to whom was referred the portion of the Annual Report which
relates to Church Extension at the South, submit the following:</p>

<p>We notice that the church work, like the educational, is growing on our hands. Five
new churches—especially if each prove a metropolitan or mother church—is a gain for
which to give thanks and from which to take courage. Sixty-five churches in all, though
most of them are connected with our educational institutions, or near them, is certainly
not a bad showing for thirteen years of labor.</p>

<p>We notice also, with pleasure, a cheering growth the last year by conversions from
the world. In fifteen only of the churches, this growth gives a total of 358 additions,
an average of twenty-four. Have our Northern churches done so well? It is equally
gratifying to learn what kind of Christians our churches South are making, or seeking
to make; to know our students are pledged to work; what these converts think of the
standard of morality enjoined by the Gospel; the honesty, purity and truth—in short,
the practical righteousness which God ordains. We rejoice to know that this Association
has planted, and is training, these Southern churches to be the salt of that part of
the earth—cities on a hill, lights in dark places—so recognized, having the reputation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>

being Bible Christians—industrious, virtuous, zealous of good works—thus already having
obtained a good report.</p>

<p>It is cheering to learn that some of the best of the pastors of these sixty-five
churches have been raised not only from bondage, but from all the degradation of
slavery—boys picked up in the street, and polished like diamonds, for the Master’s use.</p>

<p>We have certainly made a beginning in the matter of church extension, as in that
of education. Not the least gratifying feature is seen in the character, the growing
influence, and reputation, even among the whites, which these churches enjoy, though
some of them are numerically small. By your instrumentality and the grace of God,
they have learned what a Christian character is, and that Christ’s friends are not those
who can sing loud and pray loud, whether they are honest or thievish, tell the truth or
lies, are virtuous or licentious; not those who, with these immoralities, crowd sanctuaries
and make them echo; but, rather, those who keep the commandments of God.</p>

<p>This Association crowded the years before the war fighting against the extension of
slavery; then crowded the years during the war, and those immediately following it,
with efforts to teach the colored people to read the Bible; and later, devoted itself to
the work of planting higher institutions—as at Hampton and Nashville and New Orleans—in
order to make of the blacks men of a higher, nobler type, teaching and
preaching men, worthy to lead their host. Shall it now set them to no grand work of
evangelization among their fellows?</p>

<p>The question is, whether you, who have always been identified with Congregationalism,
and still love it, after long trial and large observation, will give it a fair trial South?
We rejoice in your plan to move slowly in this, and wisely. We warmly approve
your selection of Dr. J. E. Roy to reconnoitre the whole field, and report.</p>

<p>Palfrey says, “Faith in God, faith in man, and in work,” was the brief formula
taught by the founders of New England. May we not, the children of the Pilgrims,
have faith enough in God and in these men to give them the church polity of these
founders?</p>

<p>We are encouraged to recommend the planting of Congregational churches among
the blacks, because we have great advantages in so doing. The eager aspiration of the
blacks to be men, will help. Congregationalism has a clean record South. Has any
other of our leading denominations? There is no prejudice to be overcome by it, as a
polity. In the competitions of the denominations on the ground, will not there be an
advantage for us? Then, again, the colored people look upon this Association as a
tried friend, and trust it. Is not this an advantage? And, further, has not Providence
opened the South to our polity, as well as piety, in a marked manner? The work
already accomplished has shown the tree to be good, and given it favor widely, even
among the old masters. Hence the aid given to our institutions by several of the States.
Hence the high hope of many whites, that our work will do much to tone up the blacks
in all that belongs to good citizenship, good morality, and proper church discipline.
As Mohammedan Turkey, and Pagan Hawaii and India, have welcomed the Christian
homes planted among them by the missionaries, and as the mission churches have been
a leaven of light in their social and political life, so it has been, and will more and
more be, as you establish your church centres over the South.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, we approve what seems to be the thought of the Executive
Committee—to “advance its activities in the direction of saving souls at the South,
and organize churches of our polity, as really missionary centres of leavening influence.
Let the trial of our polity at the South be a fair and full one, carrying out our ideas of
Christian doctrine and morality. Thus, as we pray and believe, will that wilderness
the sooner bud and blossom like the rose.” We recommend, therefore, the adoption
of the following resolution:</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Association approves the plan of its Executive Committee—to
make a careful examination of the field at the South, and infuse new activity into its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>

church work, organizing churches, where the way is open, on the principles of the
Congregational order.</p>

<p>The resolution was adopted.</p>

<p>Rev. Edward S. Atwood, of Salem, presented the report of the committee
upon the “Chinese in America,” as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee, to whom was referred that portion of the Annual Report which relates
to mission work among the Chinese in America, would respectfully submit the
following:</p>

<p>We recognize with satisfaction the positive and demonstrable success of the Association
in this department of labor—a success emphatically evidenced by the 1,500
gathered into the day-schools; the increased usefulness of the Bethany Home;
the seventy-five conversions during the year, and the ardent desire of these newly-born
souls for the Gospel light to shine on their native and beloved land. Were we to stop
here and content ourselves with the mere statistics of progress, we should have no hesitation
in saying to the officers and the missionaries of the Association, “Servants of God,
well done!”</p>

<p>But simple justice compels a larger view of the matter. There is something to be
taken into account besides these nominal assets. The chief worth of the work done lies
in the fact that, in the doing of it, the Association has been loyal to its old and fixed
theory, that a man is a man everywhere and always, with a soul to be saved, and a
Saviour sufficient for its needs. Questions of nationality are irrelevant. The simple
fact of humanity is all that needs to be known in order to institute a legitimate claim
for the giving of the Gospel, by those who have it in trust. In this department of work,
loyalty has not been an easy matter. The rough, unreasoning passions of the mob have
glanced fiercely against it. Iniquity, baptised with the name of legislation, has endeavored
to thwart it. The conciliatory conservatism of timid, good men, has been eager to
dispense its soporific platitudes, and generous in prescribing its universal panacea for all
difficulties—“Let us have peace!” The unwarrantable enmity to the Mongolian on the
Pacific Coast has been supplemented and reinforced by the unaccountable apathy on
the Atlantic shore of the continent. Yet, undaunted by these accumulated obstacles, the
Association has said, like the great Missionary Apostle; “None of these things move
me.” “The waves of the Yellow Sea,” it has said, “break on a land peopled by men
for whom Christ died. If we can reach them without crossing thousands of intervening
leagues of ocean, so much the better.” In spite of hostility, often white-hot; in spite of
statute books, whose leaves were blistered with iniquitous provisions; in spite of the
furious rage of lawless crowds, the Association has passed through the thick and
peril of opposition of every sort, and taken by the hand the despised Mongolian, against
whom so many scowling faces were set, and so many angry hands raised, and called him
“Brother,” claiming kinship, and tendering the richest offices of help. For this, especially,
the constituency of this Association should say to its management: “Vastly well
done.” The old banner under which the Society was organized is still “full high advanced.”
It is no small honor in these degenerate times to find men who are faithful to
their trust at any cost.</p>

<p>But more than this, it is believed that in this department the Association is doing
germinal work. The few early ears that have ripened for our encouragement are types
and prophecies of a greater coming harvest. In any other view of the matter the religion
of the Gospel is spiritual class legislation. It is suited to the needs of the few and not
the many. The Cross loses its power under the shadow of the Great Wall; and men
scorn, as well they may, such a deduction as that; they are shut up to the only other
possible conclusion, that the school, the mission work, the unfolded Word, will effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
in the Pacific Coast, and among the Chinese immigrants, just what it effects here and
among us. And, therefore, we say to the Association that its high mission in this hour
is to push its work. Let it turn a deaf ear to all pleadings to stay its hand, however
plausible those pleadings may be, and from whatever quarter they may come. Let it
distrust the shallow expedients of so-called statesmen, who are even shallower than their
expedients. Let it give no heed to the unreasoning taunts and empty rage of Communism,
but push its work; secure in the fact that back of its efforts is the intelligent
Christian public sentiment of the land; and still more encouraged by the greater fact,
that the God who has made of one blood all nations, and provided one Gospel for all men,
is saying with an emphasis that cannot be mistaken, “Go forward!”</p>

<p>Rev. Geo. A. Oviatt gave the report in behalf of the committee on the
“Work of the Association in Africa” as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your Committee on so much of the report of the Executive Committee as relates to
the Mendi Mission in Africa, beg leave to submit the following:</p>

<p>At the time of the last Annual Meeting of this body, the first company of colored missionaries
was on its way to the Mendi Mission. The plan of sending out to Africa men
and women of African descent redeemed from American slavery, converted and educated
at the South, was long and thoroughly considered before it was adopted for action.
Great care was exercised in selecting this first band of colored missionaries, and it is evident
that the right workers were sent forth to test the experiment—persons of deep, earnest
piety, of more than ordinary common sense, and of sound education, as their communications
to the Executive Committee show. In February two other missionaries, and
their wives, were sent out to help the too small number of those who set sail for Africa
in September.</p>

<p>This year’s trial has proved two things: (1) That persons of African descent
can endure the sickly climate of the country of which their ancestors were natives, better
than white missionaries: and (2) That converted and educated Freedmen and women
are equal to the work of wise, thorough missionary labor in the land of their fathers.
Everything at the stations to which these brethren and sisters were sent, seems to
have been improved under their management. Converts have been multiplied and pupils
gathered into the schools in augmented numbers.</p>

<p>The call is for an enlarged number of missionaries to occupy this promising field, and
for more ample provisions to enable them to take a larger number of native children into
their homes, “to be under their care, as well as removed from the debasing influences of
their heathen surroundings.”</p>

<p>The Executive Committee express the hope that, with the strengthening of these
mission stations, “they may be made the point of departure for a mission into the interior
of Africa.”</p>

<p>It is a grand, inspiriting idea, that the men and women the best adapted to civilize
and Christianize the millions of Africa, are to be found among those who, at the South,
were so lately in bondage, and fitted for their work as foreign missionaries in Normal
schools, Colleges, and Theological Seminaries, planted and sustained by Northern philanthropists
and Christians, not on Northern but Southern soil.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee can only delay to enlarge these missionary operations
in Africa on account of the too limited amount of means in the Treasury of the Association.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>

<p>Your Committee present the following <i>Resolutions</i>:</p>

<p>1. That we recognize with heartfelt gratitude to God, His evident approval of the
plan of attempting to evangelize Africa by the sons and daughters of Africans born in
this country, brought out of slavery under the Proclamation of Emancipation of President
Lincoln, and here converted and educated for this glorious work in their fatherland.</p>

<p>2. That we cannot do otherwise than lay on the churches the responsibility of increasing
their contributions in aid of this Association, so as to enable it, at once, to enlarge its
operations connected with the Mendi Mission, in the hope of sending from this, as a
centre, bands of laborers into the interior of the continent.</p>

<h3>ADDRESS OF REV. SYLVANUS HEYWOOD.</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<span class="smcap">Mr. President and Christian Friends:</span>

<p>I do not feel that I can stand here to give any instruction, nor scarcely any stimulus,
in the work you are engaged in. Your presence is enough for that. But there are four
or five points which seem to need special emphasis at this time—points upon which there
appears to be some doubt in the minds of the people of the North.</p>

<p>First, is there absolute necessity of a higher education for the Freedmen in the United
States? I do not say of a common-school education, for all admit the necessity of that.
But I apprehend that there are many people who doubt the policy of founding universities
at the South. I have a suspicion that thousands of dollars have been withheld
from this Association for that very reason. This seems to me a most important work. I
think upon it depends the vital principle of equal rights for all. You may enact laws,
and hedge them about with penalties for securing the rights of the blacks, but law alone
will prove a failure. But give to them the highest Christian culture, and they will not
only demand, but command, their rights. Give them a common-school education, and it
will be a blessing to them; but with nothing more, they will remain but hewers of wood
and drawers of water. They will be <em>in</em> society, but not <em>of</em> it. But give them the highest
culture among cultured men, and the case will be far different. It is too late in the
day to raise the question whether they are capable of this. This Association has demonstrated
that, day by day. I have spent ten years as a teacher among the whites, and
two among the blacks; and I must say that I accomplished more in those two years than
in the ten—more in the way of giving instruction. I say it is too late to raise that question
at all. It is already demonstrated. Let them be educated with broad culture. Let
them have the training that will put them in possession of practical skill, such as shall
win success. Let them have their own lawyers, well trained in legal lore, so that they
shall be able—in that natural eloquence in which they excel—to carry conviction to dignified
courts. Let them have clergymen, not only earnest and sanctified, but able to
cope with the deep things of science and theology—men able to stand before the most
learned bodies. Let them have statesmen, well grounded in philosophy, history and
government, so that they will be able not only to win victories upon the stump, but in
the halls of legislation. Let their homes become homes of Christian culture and social
refinement Then, and not till then, will they cease to struggle for their rights, and will
take them; and not a dog will dare wag his tongue against them.</p>

<p>I feel that this is a subject of the most vital importance. Whoever considers it, I
think will say that this Association has been wise in planting these influences at the
South. I believe that here lies the master-key to its social and political problems.</p>

<p>The next point to which I would call your attention is the necessity of planting new
churches all over the South—Congregational churches. People ask if they need such
churches down there now. Certainly; and it is practically impossible to work there without
them. We must work there with them. We have heard to-day that the old churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
in the shadow of our institutions have grown purer and better. It is absolutely necessary
that there should be an influence from the outside upon these churches. Men ask
after the Uncle Toms of the South—ask if it is all imagination. By no means. The
Uncle Toms of the South are met just about as frequently as the Harlan Pages of the
North.</p>

<p>Men say that the old churches largely stand in the way of their own people.
People testify that one of the greatest obstacles in the way of this educational question
is to be found in the pastors themselves of those churches. As a class, they do not want
their flocks to know more than they do. This is one of the greatest difficulties to be contended
with. We must have churches outside of the old ones. Does not the grace of
God abound in them? Yes, I believe there are multitudes who have it. But when that
question is asked, I am always reminded of that familiar anecdote of the old clergyman
who had a fair daughter who was noted for her violent temper. A young man became
enamored of her, and asked for her hand. The old man was not willing to palm off
damaged goods. He said, “It is not wise to take her.” “Why not?” said the young
man; “isn’t she a Christian; isn’t she converted?” “Yes,” said the old man, “but
you must remember that the grace of God can live where you and I can’t.” So the
grace of God can bring forth influences to serve Him down there, but these churches
stand as an obstacle. It is absolutely necessary to form new churches, that we be not
burdened by the old effete organizations. I believe in Congregationalism. It may be
very well for those of a different polity to talk of the God of the hills and the valleys
and the dry places and streams; but our God is the King of the whole earth. It may be
well for those of a different polity to quote their different authorities, but the only authority
we recognize is the authority of Him whose dominion stretches from sea to sea
and from pole to pole. Such is Congregationalism. It is adapted to every human being
God has made. It may indeed take on different forms. You have pure, limpid water.
Pour it into different vessels, but it will be the same limpid water still. So, take Congregationalism
in the tropics or wherever you please, and it will be Congregationalism
still.</p>

<p>Brother Pike would not pardon me if I did not allude to Africa. The ways of God
are mysterious. We must walk by faith, and not by sight. We hear His voice saying,
“This is the way; walk ye in it.” In this darkness we see His hand. The providence
of God towards this nation, for generations, was exceedingly mysterious. But during the
last forty years it has been becoming exceedingly clear. In the raising of this Society
and the doing away with slavery, we can see almost visibly the hand of God displayed
upon the midnight sky, pointing to that dark continent, saying we should send these
freemen forth as apostles of light, to purify and make glad their ancestral homes. And I
believe the providence of God is leading us to still greater achievements.</p>

<p>This Association, born amid the throes of slavery, is almost the only organization
that stands for that principle which underlies the oneness of humanity. It seems to
have been raised up that through it the churches might bring their influence to bear
upon the vital issue of the hour. What is it? The same as it has been from the beginning
of this nation—the same as in India—caste is the barrier everywhere. The battle
rages to-day from Maine to California between classes of men. It is for this Association
to stand up and contend against the foes that arise against whatever is good and right.
If this Association ever hesitates thus to stand, whether it be in South Carolina, Massachusetts,
or the Black Hills, then will its prestige be lost. But, thank God, there is no
such fate for this Society. When the wolves of Communism are barking about our
doors; when the shrieks of degrading socialism come up into our ears, it is no time to
hesitate. It is time to resist their filth and set up the banner of that pure Gospel, under
whose folds can be no bondman—neither Chinaman nor black—but where all shall
enjoy the equality of the sons of God. We can almost see the hand of God visibly pouring
into this nation from all sides as into the extended hopper of a mighty mill, that
here they may be amalgamated. Here He brought the red man of the forest; then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Anglo-Saxon race; then He reached out to Africa and plucked up the black diamond;
then He sent the phlegmatic Teutons and the Scandinavians; and even now He is opening
old Cathay and pouring upon us swarms of Asiatics. “He hath made of one blood
all nations of men that dwell upon the face of the whole earth.” There is no proposition
which so awakens the fiendish hate of mankind as this. States and nations are
rising up in indignation against this purpose of God. It belongs to Christian people to
stand up and denounce God’s curse on whoever shall deny His will. Accursed be he
who dares to keep out any nation or tribe under the heavens! Accursed any political
party that goes through the country trying to raise a quarrel between men! Yea,
accursed will be the nation itself that dares to make enactments to separate or make
distinctions between races of men! It belongs to Christian people to stand up, and,
in the teeth of antagonism, in defiance of States, governments, legislatures, and
Protestant Congresses in the United States—to declare, “What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.”</p>

<p>There are many insects from which we shrink with loathing. But here comes the
naturalist who takes his lens and pours in upon the insect the solar ray, and we stand
back in amazement at the beauty and perfection of the work of God. It is the duty of
us all to act the part of the naturalist towards these despised races—these degraded
classes. Let us put them under the lens of that wonderful utterance: “Inasmuch
as ye did it unto one of the least of these ye did it unto me.” Pour into that lens the
light of the last day, and we shall see them endued with the majesty of the Most High God.</p>

<p>I believe this the pressing duty of the hour. If we shall take counsel of our fears—if
we are afraid to let Christianity grapple with infidel Romanism, even with heathenism,
God will remand us back to forty years in the wilderness, <a name="Err_4" id="Err_4"></a>but will bring in our children
to drive out these Anakim of our faithless terror.</p>

<h3>ADDRESS ON CHINESE MISSIONS IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="center">REV. E. S. ATWOOD.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am requested to add to the written report a few words, which will be unreasonably
brief, in view of the importance of the subject. I count it a great misfortune that we should
have been obliged to postpone to the last, weary, unenthusiastic hours of our meeting, the
consideration of a subject which is one of the great problems this Association is set to solve.
It would have been well for us if we had been allowed time to open the information
that is accessible to us on this subject. There are many who think the Chinese question
a very small affair. We get but faint rumors of it on these Eastern shores. Yet that
little cloud on the Western horizon, not larger than a man’s hand to-day, is destined to
cover the whole land, and will either be found to be filled with tempests or refreshing
rain, according as the people meet the exigencies of the hour. The Chinese question
will by-and-by, I believe, assume a proportion quite equal to that of the negro question.
There is this peculiarity about it—almost every other department of work in this
Association is amply provided for. The question of the evangelization of the Indian is
comparatively a temporary question; for not many generations will pass before only a
scattered remnant of Indian tribes will be left in this land. The welfare and lifting up
of the black race is continually under consideration. But who cares for the Chinese?
The discussion in regard to them is limited and local. And yet their presence on this
continent is a matter of national interest. It starts grave problems, that have somehow
to be studied and solved.</p>

<p>There are three classes in the land to-day who are studying this question, and are
giving us their conclusions upon it. First of all, we have the Communists, east and west,
who are trying to grapple with the question, and settle it. We have one Dennis Kearney
going up and down the land, and men say he is a loud-mouthed demagogue, whose
utterances have no weight of public opinion behind them. Not at all, Mr. President.
Dennis Kearney is a representative man—a John the Baptist, crying, “Prepare ye the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
way of the Devil, and make his paths straight.” Communism, as a whole, proposes to
deal with the Chinese, by driving them out from the land. If you doubt that assertion,
look at the facts. Documentary statements in regard to the matter, compiled by B. S.
Brooks, an eminent counsellor on the Pacific Coast, have been presented to a Joint Commission
of both Houses of Congress. I wish they could be put into the hands of every
Christian man. Unfortunately, the books that give any real information on these statistics
are somehow not easily accessible. This setting forth of facts in the documents of
Mr. Brooks, shows incontrovertibly that Communism in California is murderous in its
intent towards the Chinese.</p>

<p>It has put its intention into acts. It has outraged unoffending men, and struck them
down relentlessly in the public street. Violence of that sort is comparatively safe. The
testimony of the Chinaman cannot be taken in opposition to the white man. The only
chance a Chinaman, who is about to be murdered, has to obtain justice, is to secure a
white witness to see it done. The rougher element on the Western coast is bound to
annihilate the Chinaman. And all for no good reason. They are not numerous. There
are only 100,000 Chinamen scattered up and down the coast. They foment no disturbances.
There are only two offenses charged against them—grave offenses—and these
are, that they live economically, and don’t get drunk; and so are able to work for lower
wages than the masses of the Irish and native-born population.</p>

<p>There is another power trying to solve this problem, and that is the politicians. They
are no more successful than the Communists. They have secured the enactment of certain
statutes, but those statutes are often iniquitous. The Legislature of California has
enacted what seems to me the most infamous laws that ever disgraced any statute-book.
The Fugitive Slave Law was a Golden Rule in comparison. Let us see. It is well
known that the Chinamen are laundry men. They do their work in their shops, and
carry it out themselves. Forthwith, the Legislature of San Francisco enacts that every
laundryman who carries his work out with a horse shall pay a dollar a month; but every
laundryman who carries it out by hand shall pay <span class="smcap">fifteen</span> dollars a month.</p>

<p>The Chinese are gregarious. They crowd together in tenement-houses, from which
people of other nationalities are excluded. By Section Second of an Act approved April
3, 1876, by the Legislature of California, it is provided that “Any person or persons
found sleeping or lodging, or who hires or uses for the purpose of sleeping, any room or
apartment which contains less than 500 cubic feet of space in the clear, for each person
so occupying such room or apartment, shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor, and shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than ten, or more than fifty dollars, or
by both such fine and imprisonment.” That is, says Mr. Brooks, as a penalty for lodging
in rooms containing less than 500 cubic feet of space, they are to be thrust into
prison cells of less than one-fifth the dimension. Certainly</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For ways that are dark, and tricks that are vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The heathen Chinee is [<span class="smcap">not</span>] peculiar.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Luttrell moved in Congress that the steamboat bills be so amended as to forbid
the employment of a Chinaman in any capacity whatsoever. Congressman Shelley, of
Alabama, introduced a bill providing that all Chinamen coming to the United States,
except officially, be taxed $250 per capita, or serve five years in the penitentiary.
The Chinese in California are made to pay more than $42,000 school taxes annually,
while their children are not admitted to the public schools, neither are there other schools
provided for them. Thirteen hundred Chinamen asked the California Legislature for school
privileges for 3,000 of their children, seeking only such as are provided for those of African
and Indian descent. Their petition was immediately laid on the table, and stigmatized
as dangerous. This is only a specimen of this class legislation on the Pacific Coast.
They are very ingenious there. Just as fast as one law is decided unconstitutional, they
have another.</p>

<p>Communism crushes the Chinese. The politician says, “They sha’n’t come here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>

if we can prevent it by oppressive legislation.” As a protest against the unreasonableness
of this course of procedure, the testimony of Postmaster-General Key is of special
value. In a recent conversation, he gave the following as the result of his observations
during his visit to the Pacific Coast: “The politicians,” said Mr. Key, “are almost
to a man against the Chinese, and antagonize them bitterly. The merchants, the
manufacturers, the farmers, and nearly the entire employing class, are very fond of the
Chinese, and prefer them to any other laborers. They speak in the highest terms of
the Chinese; they say that they are docile, obedient, obliging, punctual, hardworking,
and faithful; they are exceedingly thrifty and economical; they are temperate in their
habits, do not drink liquor of any kind, eat very little meat, and live almost entirely on
rice. It is wonderful to see how little a Chinaman can live on. Their economy struck
me as something marvellous. Large numbers of them sleep in a single ill-ventilated
room; they constantly violate the fundamental laws of health, yet they are seemingly
very healthy. I was astonished to learn they had no hospital. I was shown through
the Chinese Quarter of San Francisco by the Mayor, and saw everything in that locality;
but there are a number of places here in Washington fully as bad, if not worse, than anything
I saw in Chinatown. I also observed that the railroad companies employed a large
number of Chinamen, and found them excellent workmen.” Evidently, the politicians
are not competent to the settlement of the Chinese question.</p>

<p>The American Missionary Association takes hold of the matter in the right way. It
says: Let the Chinese come and be treated as men. Let them have the gospel preached
to them, and be lifted into a civilization that is level with your own. Communism has
not succeeded, so far. The politician has not succeeded. The American Missionary
Association has shown itself able to grapple with the question. They have got hold of
the right end of the rope. If they are encouraged by the churches of America, they will
solve this problem.</p>

<p>There appeared in the <cite>Congregationalist</cite>, some weeks ago, an editorial of great merit,
in which this radical mistake was made: it was a sort of apology for the Chinese, because
they were so few in numbers. It said they were decreasing instead of increasing.
Why, Mr. Chairman, look across the ocean and see that great nation, covering one-tenth
of the globe, and holding one-third its population. So crowded is it that millions
(even more than our entire population) who never have a home upon land, are born, live
and die floating upon rivers and canals. A more industrious race is not; neither can
agriculture, which still ranks far above any other employment, be found anywhere else
carried to such perfection of thoroughness. There is no idleness among these millions.
The monstrous human ant-heap is astir. They are also an educated people, nimble in
figures, as well as in all kinds of labor. There is but one written language for all the
population, which has been transmitted, with even no dialectic changes, for at least 2,500
years. It is a nation industrious and frugal. We talk about the heathen Chinese, but
we had better talk about the heathen Anglo-Saxon. What useful art is practised to-day
that China has not had for centuries? What we count the great discoveries of modern
science, may turn out not to be so modern after all. I saw a statement made within
ten days, that it has been discovered that Edison’s phonograph was known in China two
hundred years before Edison was born. China has a history—a record which cannot be
ignored.</p>

<p>We do vastly ill when we talk about the “heathen Chinee.” Their religion is something
against which we set our faces; but their character is worth commendation. I
was talking, the other day, with a gentleman who had passed the greater part of his
life in China. He said there was not an element in the Japanese character that was not
in the Chinese, and of the two, he considers the Chinese the more hopeful. In dealing
with the Chinese, we are not dealing with refuse material. China is a great nation. It
has its place among the foremost of the earth. It is a sad thing for this great nation of
ours, if it cannot endure the little leaven on the Pacific Coast. Do you suppose it will
affect the great mass of Christianity unfavorably?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>

<p>Over 300 of the Chinese have already been received as members of the Protestant
Churches in California, and 700 are under Christian instruction, studying the doctrines
of our faith, while 1,000 attend Sunday-school, and two young men are preparing
for the Christian ministry. Even those who do not come under the influence of such
instruction can scarcely be said to be the worst people in the land. In 1875, of the 7,643
arrests for drunkenness, not one was a Chinaman; of the 3,263 paupers admitted to
the alms-house, only six were Chinamen; of 83 murderers hanged during the last
year in the United States, not one was a Chinaman.</p>

<p>If any other race, born or naturalized, on this continent, can show a similarly good
record, let them step to the front and declare it.</p>

<p>The truth is, Mr. President, we are only standing on the threshold of this great
question. I believe if you and I live to come to these meetings ten years hence, less will
be said about the blacks and more about the Chinese. We need to understand this great
work now opening before us. We ought to remove one source of prejudice against the
Chinese. Men say the Chinese must go, because their coming reduces their wages. I
happen to have a statement of wages in California for the past year, clipped only a few
months since from a San Francisco paper: Carpenters, from $3 to $3.50; bricklayers,
$4 to $5; painters, $3; plasterers, $3.50; hod-carriers, $3; stone-cutters, $4; machinists,
$3 to $4; common laborers, $2; house work in families, per week, $6 to $7. Can
we make a show equally in favor of the wages of the workingmen on this sun-rise side
of the continent, where the Chinese are insignificant as a competing power? The truth
is, all this cry about their taking the bread out of our children’s mouths is simply
nonsense.</p>

<p>But it is said there is another difficulty. The Irishman comes to this country, and
is assimilated. The German, also, and is assimilated. The Chinaman comes, and he alone
is not assimilated. Why not? First of all there is no provision for his naturalization, if
he desires it. The sixth article of the Burlingame Treaty provides that “Chinese subjects
visiting or residing in the United States, shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities
and exemptions in respect to travel or residence as may be enjoyed by the citizen-subjects
of the most favored nation; but nothing herein contained shall be held to confer
naturalization upon the citizens of the United States in China, nor upon subjects of
China in the United States.” More than this, there is a certain stress of public opinion,
which is weightier than treaty provisions. The head of the Chinese Embassy in
this country was confronted with this question; <a name="Err_5" id="Err_5"></a>“Why is it that your countrymen come
here alone, without any families?” He replied: “It is about as much as a Chinaman
can do to keep his head on his shoulders alone, without bringing his family.” There is
nothing in the nature of things to prevent the absorption of the Mongolian into American
citizenship. It seems to be the peculiar office of this nation to assimilate every
element. It makes no difference what our estimate of a man is; if he is a man he can,
by the power of the gospel, be brought into oneness with us. Walk up and down the
pavement of the mosque of St. Sophia, and here and there you brush with your steps
bits of gilded and colored glass that, rude in shape and void of beauty, seem only fit to
be swept into a corner; but lift your eyes to the seraphim that blaze in flaming mosaics
on the ceiling, and you see how the artist’s skill has wrought just such rough fragments
into forms of grandeur that awe the soul. Our American Christianity gathers the best
and the worst of the race forces of the world, and is able, by God’s good help, out of
them to compact a nationality with which to face the world.</p>

<p>“The Chinese must go,” Mr. Kearney says. Yes, we accept that motto, but we put
our own meaning to it. We say, “the Chinese must go” and come, whenever and
wherever they please. This Association is called of God, I believe, to stand up and
assert that, as it has opportunity, no effort shall be spared to give them place among the
sanctified of the land.</p></div>

<h3>ADDRESS UPON THE AFRICAN MISSION.</h3>

<p class="center">REV. G. D. PIKE.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>:—In seconding the report respecting the Mendi Mission, I beg
leave to say, that there are four points of interest we ought to consider.</p>

<p>1. One is the Providential call of this Association to Tropical Africa. At the beginning
of its existence, as Abraham heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Get thee
out of thy country, into a land I will shew thee,” so the fathers of this Association
heard the call of God and entered the Dark Continent, anticipatory of those great
events about to transpire. In 1842, when the Mendi Mission was established by the
return of the Amistad captives, who had been freed from slavery in America, the most
important parts of Central Africa were either left blank on our maps, or filled up with
great deserts, mountains of the moon, and figures of lions and dragons. It was
known, however, that the Mendi country was a great slave preserve, from which ten
thousand black people were sent annually into bondage. The Amistad Committee at
once pre-ëmpted a portion of that great and wonderful missionary field, which is now
so signally attracting the attention of the civilized world.</p>

<p>2. A second point of interest pertains to the land that has been shown us.</p>

<p>By turning to your maps, you will discover that the back lot of the Mendi Mission
extends eastwards 4,200 miles, on the parallel of about seven degrees north latitude,
over a fertile zone of tropical country. Mr. Stanley tells us the object of his journey
was, “To flash a torch of light across the western half” of this zone. Other explorers
have contributed their light. Lieutenant Burton, in ’57, carried his torch as far as the
Tanganyika. Captain Speke announced to the world about the same time that he had
discovered a mighty inland sea, surrounded on every side by the “richest and pleasantest
garden in the world;” and the Victoria Nyanza Lake, with Mtesa’s kingdom, were
added to our knowledge and wealth—alluring alike to the statesman, merchant and missionary.
Meanwhile David Livingstone moved up from the southeast, illumining the
whole regions of the Zambezi River—the Nyassa, Bangweolo and Tanganyika Lakes—proceeding
as far as Nyangwe on the unknown Lualaba—scattering through all his
reports those seed thoughts respecting Christian missions, that have developed into
desires to carry the light of life to the “real heathen” in those latitudes. Then, Sir
Samuel Baker called the attention of the world afresh to ancient Ethiopia, with one
hundred and forty millions of acres of the richest land in the world; covered with millions
of people, herds of cattle, and a varied and luxurious vegetation. Discovering
also the Albert Nyanza Lake, embosomed amidst mountain ranges—the abodes of frost
and snow—and hardy, warlike tribes. Dr. Schweinfurth also penetrated far into the
back lot of our mission; flashing his chemical and botanical light, revealing most
beautiful flora—every variety of fauna and fish—to say nothing of pigmies and giants.
Neither has Commander Cameron contributed the least by his journey across the Continent
from East to West. The light given us by these seven explorers is woven into
a rainbow of promise, which spans those unknown slave preserves of former generations—beautiful
as “Canaan’s fair and happy land” to the Father of the faithful.</p>

<p>If you start from our Mendi Mission and proceed a few hundred miles southeast,
you enter the West African gold fields in Ashantee land, where the native rulers are
covered with golden ornaments, carrying gold-hilted swords, and attended by hundreds
of followers, wearing gold plates upon their breasts, with royal cooks serving their
masters with golden spoons. If you journey still farther, to one degree of North
latitude on the Livingstone, you reach a country where they build their temples of
ivory, and construct their boats with accommodations for eighty oarsmen, and fight
their battles with vast armies. If you keep straight on, you reach Munza’s kingdom,
“enriched by such beauties as might be worthy of Paradise.” Still further, you see the
arena of the missionary labors of Rev. Chas. New; where high mountains rise one above
another until they are lost in clouds—mountains with beautiful slopes, covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
with patches of cultivated land, and irrigated by brooks, streams and torrents, which
tumble and splash on all sides. Meanwhile, you would have journeyed over countries
six thousand feet above the level of the sea with an equable climate, and other favorable
conditions, such as led Captain Speke to prophecy that in course of time “one of the
greatest nations on earth” would be built up in the heart of Africa.</p>

<p>3. But there is another point of quite as much interest to us. I refer to the inspirations
that have been kindled in the hearts of Christians in Africa’s behalf; the efforts
that have been put forth since our Mission was established for reclaiming Africa.
Here let me refer briefly to parallel Providences. There are three of these which are
very striking: (1) The revelations to us of the fertility, resources and people of the
vast interior of Central Africa; (2) The abolition of American slavery; (3) The
eagerness of people of African descent for education at the South, coupled with a
great desire to emigrate to Africa (It is probable that not less than half a million
black people in America have signified their desire to go to Africa within the last
twelve months). To this must be added the desire manifested by Christians of our
own race, everywhere to follow up these providences with missionary endeavors.
These have been put forth by the English, Scotch, German and American; skirting
the borders of Equatorial Africa, both on the East and West Coast; resulting in the
conversion of thousands of heathen during the past twenty-five years. Since the
close of our war, and more especially during the past five years, great enthusiasm has
been manifested for what are termed Central African Missions—missions in the lake
regions upon the highlands of the interior.</p>

<p>The Scotch and English have planted their stations on the Nyassa Lake. The London
Missionary Society had, at last reports, a corps of missions, heading towards the
Tanganyika, while the Church Missionary Society has occupied Mtesa’s kingdom, in
Uganda, on the shores of the Victoria Nyanza, and the Baptists of Great Britain are
searching for a station on the Livingstone River. The fertile country thus being entered,
extends for four thousand miles from east to west, in some latitudes, and three
thousand from north to south, and probably contains a hundred million people.</p>

<p>In the providence of God, the American Missionary Association is on that ground.
It is the one missionary society of our denomination that sustains missions there. We
believe we have an inheritance in that country, and a great destiny in connection with
its redemption. We have been true to the negro from the beginning, seeking to do
right in his behalf, without fear or favor. I think it is not too much to assert that
heaven believes in this Association; that God created it, and will use it for great things
in Africa. Good men have believed in it. Mr. Avery gave to it property valued at
$100,000, for African Missions. Others, we trust, will follow his example; for we suspect
the negro was right when his attentive ear caught the accents which he wove into
his song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“The Lord said to Gabriel:<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Take down the silver trumpet,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Loud as the seven thunders!<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Wake the sleeping nations—<br /></span>
<span class="i5">You will see the Christian rising.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are truly seeing the Christian rising—as “the trumpet sounds it in our souls”—that
God has come to reclaim Africa.</p>

<p>4. The fourth point of interest relates to what we have been trying to do about it.
The story of the departure of our colored missionaries has been sufficiently told. The
result of their first year’s efforts has been spread before you. Let me give you, in
their own language, their convictions as to the best missions for Africa. Mr. A. E.
White—a Hampton student, now at Avery Station—writes: “You would like to know
what I think about colored missionaries. My firm belief is that they can do more than
any other missionaries under the sun. The natives look upon a white person as unnatural,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and think he is above them in every way, and that God made him so. They
also think it is of no use for them to try to do the things they see the white man do.
But, on the other hand, when they see a colored man do anything, they think if he can
do it, they can do it themselves. Do not think I say this because I am a colored man.
I say it because I know it is true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Albert Miller, who went out from the Fisk University, writes: “If Africa is to
be evangelized, as I believe it will be, it must be done through the children of the
summer and sunny clime, educated and Christianized in the South. You in America
can’t see this as plainly as one who mingles with this people, and has all chances to investigate
in regard to this matter.”</p>

<p>It gives us pleasure to state that the success of our colored band beyond the great
waters, warrants as strong expressions as those I have quoted. A letter from Rev.
Floyd Snelson, dated West Africa, September 13th, contains the following: “The 24th
of this month will make one year since we left New York. Result of work, three
stations are opened, nearly three hundred children have been enrolled in the day
schools, and about the same number, old and young, in Sabbath-schools. From among
these numbers, twenty-four have given their hearts to Christ and united with the
Church, and are endeavoring to lead Christian lives. The object of the missionary is
to go forward with the work into the interior. There are many places which might be
opened to the saving of souls, if the money and men were furnished.”</p>

<p>I repeat, brethren, we had an early call to our African field. God has spanned His
bow of light and promise over it. He has kindled inspirations in our hearts concerning
it. He has prospered the freedmen who have gone forth for its redemption.</p>

<p>Surely we have a right to believe “the great Admiral, who knows the way,” has
taken our ship in tow, and, as the Jubilees sing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The old Ark is a movering, a movering, a movering;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The old Ark is movering, a movering along.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shall we remember our birthright, and enter more fully upon our inheritance?
Shall we go up, with the other great missionary societies, to possess this land? Shall
we return over the sea, with songs and rejoicing, those sable sons and daughters, whose
fathers came with chains and groans to our American shore?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our great work at the South, I verily believe this to be our greatest,
and that the mighty Ruler of all events will crown our efforts in this direction
with magnificent success. Therefore, Mr. President, I most heartily second this
Report.</p></div>

<div class="article">

<h3>THE ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>


<p>We have given, as usual, in the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> next following our Annual Meeting, a
large part of our increased space to the Report of the Executive Committee, the minutes
of the meeting, and the addresses made on that occasion. Here we need only to
add a few general observations on the special features of the three days at Taunton.</p>

<p>First of all, the attendance was gratifying both as to numbers and quality. The
earlier sessions drew together more people than are ordinarily present at the start;
and, despite the two rainy days which followed, the numbers increased to the end.
The evening meetings were crowded, and, had the weather been fine, would have doubtless
overflowed, so as to have made the opening of a second church necessary. It
was a representative gathering, too, of ministers, well known for their active interest
in all good works, and of substantial laymen from Massachusetts and the coasts beyond.
We should be glad if, more and more, the men who contribute either largely or
statedly to our work, would come to these assemblies, and question the methods of our
work and of our administration of their gifts. The executive officers of the Association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
desire to maintain relations of perfect frankness with those whose trustees they
are, are glad to answer all inquiries, and to submit to all intelligent criticism, to meet
with the special committees when requested, and to give all possible information;—sure
that, as in this case, such detailed knowledge of their ways and works will only furnish
a better basis for the confidence, so largely given, of the churches and the
friends of the lowly.</p>

<p>We need not repeat here what is fully set forth in the preceding pages—the reports
of the year’s work and of its indorsement by the constituency of the Association.
Rather we will confine ourselves to the things which do not there appear.</p>

<p>The sermon, on the first evening, by Rev. S. E. Herrick, D. D., was full of grand
thoughts, clothed in words of forceful grace, from the text: “But ye <em>are</em> a chosen generation,
a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew
forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous
light.”—1. Peter, ii, 9.</p>

<p>Three thoughts were deduced from those words set forth, and with ample illustration:
(1) God has a people in the world, not marked by geographical or race lines,
and yet one people and one nation, who are such through their relation to God by Jesus
Christ; (2) This people has undergone a marvellous transformation from darkness
into His light; (3) It is intrusted with a solemn priestly function, a sacrificial work,
for the redemption of men. The special priestly work of God’s people in this land was
set forth, and the historic fact that, having failed to fulfill it, they were made to suffer
on the altar of sacrifice, and that unless they should meet the obligations of their
office now, they must again be called to an account.</p>

<p>Five papers of great value were read during the meetings. These have been printed
in full in the supplement to the Boston <cite>Traveller</cite>, and largely circulated among our
friends.</p>

<p>1. “The Present Time all-important in the salvation of our Country,” by Rev. Stacy
Fowler, D.D. The paper showed how this was a critical time in our history as a
nation; the great need, a revival of “the American spirit,” especially in these three respects—the
nation’s faith in God, the purity of the family, and the elevation of the
lowly. The Church must do the work. Incidentally, a strong argument was made to
show the deteriorating tendency of the amalgamation of races, sustained by the testimony
of Prof. Lewis Agassiz.</p>

<p>2. “The Denominational Polity of the American Missionary Association,” by Rev.
G. L. Walker, D. D. The real question is, shall we only seek to Christianize, or shall
we also try to Congregationalize the Freedmen? The paper discussed the nature of
Congregationalism, and the prevalent characteristics of the colored race; and, from the
comparison, drew conclusions not very favorable to the prospects of denominational
success, yet by no means discrediting what has already been accomplished in that direction,
or discouraging further efforts.</p>

<p>3. “America’s Opportunity the World’s Salvation,” by Rev. C. L. Woodworth.
The end of Christian work is to spread the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
This needs human activities, directed with strategic wisdom and sanctified energy.
Each nation has its peculiar work: England to send forth Christian and civilizing
agencies through her widely scattered colonies; America to Christianize the peoples
from other lands who come to her shores; and to send back, through them, the Gospel of
Christian civilization to their benighted countrymen.</p>

<p>4. “A Revival of Righteousness toward the Despised Races of America,” by Rev.
Ebenezer Cutler, D. D. That they are despised is the main indictment which the
paper details at length. This unrighteousness prejudices our Christian work, restrains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
the heartiness of many, even, who are engaged in it, and hinders the blessing of God on
our labors. This revival must begin by reflection, leading to repentance; must go on to
the repeal of unjust and the execution of just laws, to a righteous public sentiment,
and such atonement as can be made for past wrongs.</p>

<p>5. “The Work of Half a Generation among the Freedmen,” by Secretary Strieby,
in which the progress since emancipation was traced, supported by much important
testimony, in material, educational and religious prosperity.</p>

<p>We have given these brief analyses only to serve as an index to the contents of
these papers, and not at all as a substitute for their perusal. Still less would it be
possible to make good to our readers the misfortune of their absence from this inspiring
gathering. We are confident that we shall feel the impulse of it through the year.</p>
</div>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">

<p>We are close upon the threshold of a new year. The churches, many of them, at
this time, are making up their schedules of benevolence for 1879. Do not forget,
we pray you, to give a good place to the Association, whose work is among
the least of these, the Master’s brethren, in our own land. Do not forget, you who
apportion your weekly contributions among the various fields, to give its due share, as
God shall give you light, to this peculiar work which presses its claims by so many
sacred pleas, and on the timely cultivation of which depend so largely the permanence
and purity of the spring itself. We would not have you neglect Judea, and Samaria,
nor even the uttermost parts of the earth, but only beseech you, earnestly and tearfully,
<em>Don’t forget Jerusalem</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several thousand dollars of the money pledged for the reduction of our debt, is
made conditional upon our paying up the full amount by the end of this year. We
beg our friends to bear this fact in mind, as a spur to make their thoughts quicker, and
their hands obey their generous promptings without delay. We cannot afford to lose
this offered help, and you cannot afford to have us. The impetus given at the Annual
Meeting to this debt-destroying work is not abated; our friends are reminding us of
their interest daily; some of those who were present at the meeting are pressing it, on
their own account, in the States from which they came. How soon will you enable
us to make our proclamation of emancipation from this bondage?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our readers will see that we have endeavored, in this number of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, to
present them with the doings and the sayings of the Annual Meeting not already put
into print and circulation. The valuable and stirring addresses by Rev. Messrs. Atwood,
Heywood and Pike, we have been able to get in form already. Other equally thoughtful
and forcible addresses, though reported, have not yet come to us in such shape that
we can use them immediately. What you find here is what you did not find in the Supplement
to the <cite>Traveller</cite>. We beg you, then, to “read, mark, learn and inwardly digest.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A new cartridge, No. 5, of the series of pamphlets begun last year, is ready for distribution,
and contains Secretary Strieby’s review of half a generation of work among
the Freedmen. As a collation of facts and testimony, we commend it as furnishing to
thoughtful men the means of forming their own opinions on the success of past labors,
and on the hopefulness and the duty of pressing on the good work already begun
patiently to the desired end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three Communion Sets are needed for as many churches near Talladega, Ala.
Churches at the North can make good use of their old ones if they are about to replace
them with new.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We invite attention to the call of Mr. Connett, in another column, for means to
erect cheap cottages for the accommodation of students. The small sum needed for
each cottage will enable many of our readers to accomplish a definite and useful object,
who cannot undertake larger enterprises. We indorse most heartily the appeal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Rebecca Tyler Bacon, daughter of Rev. Leonard Bacon, D.D., died at New
Haven, Ct., October 26th, 1878. She was a woman of rare gifts, of great intelligence,
and of extraordinary ability. She had the true missionary spirit in a self-sacrificing devotion
for the welfare of others, especially of the unfortunate and the debased.</p>

<p>The Normal Institute, at Hampton, Va., was much indebted to her wise management
for its successful organization, and the impress of her mind and spirit will remain while
that institution stands. She was a power for good in her native city, where her counsel
and direction were given to many public and private charities, with untiring devotion.</p>

<p>Her faithful and tender ministry as the eldest daughter and sister, amid trials and sorrow,
are best appreciated by those whom she cheered, and comforted, and strengthened.
Thousands in our churches will deeply sympathize with her honored and venerable father
in this bereavement.</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Wilmington, N. C.</span>—Religious interest is reported. Two young men have been
received into the church. Others seem very thoughtful. “Our little flock is a
working one.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">McLeansville, N. C.</span>—The Lord’s Supper was administered, October 13th, to about

<h3>ATLANTA, GA.</h3>

<h4>Students’ Reports of Summer Work.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MRS. T. N. CHASE.</p>


<p>School has opened with larger numbers
than for several years. Our graduates
seem to be doing much toward recommending
the school. The first Sabbath
afternoon of each new school-year is given
up to reports from our students, who have
been teaching through our summer vacation
of three months. Nothing in all our
school work interests me so much as these
reports. The only alloy in my enjoyment
is that thousands of Northern friends,
whose hearts would be equally cheered by
them, cannot enjoy them too.</p>

<p>Those who attend meetings of the A. B.
C. F. M., and are thrilled with the reports
of returned missionaries, know something
of our pleasure. Yet, I suspect ours is
greater, for these missionaries are of our own
training, many of them led to Jesus in our
own school, and the fields reported are the
benighted spots of our native land.</p>

<p>I will copy a few jottings, hastily taken
at the time. The first one says: “I have
the same old story to report, except a few
new things. Have taught in Monroe Co.
for four summers. The first year no white
people visited the school; the second
two came; the third year four; this year
thirty or forty. All think highly of Atlanta
University, and the Commissioner
begged me to supply the county with
teachers from this school. People are not
willing to sell land. Colored people doing
well as they can; anxious to get up higher
and want teachers to help them up.”</p>

<p>Another says: “I had a half hour of
Bible study each morning. Devoted part
of Friday afternoons to talks against tobacco
and whiskey. All the Sunday-school
material the people had was a catechism
and some papers left locked up by the last
Atlanta teacher and not used since. Only
four colored people own land. Landowners
seem to ask such a price as they know
never can be paid. Some bargain for land,
and then pay enormous interest. One man
pays one hundred and fifty dollars a year
interest—all he can save. I advised them
to save their money till they got enough to
pay cash for their land. Met several white
young men, professing Christians, and had
pleasant talks with them. Closed school a
little before it was time to return, and
picked cotton in the meantime.”</p>

<p>One of our girls, who graduates this
year, says: “The people seem poorer than
last year; crops failed. The land is poor,
and they pay high rent for it. But the
children are advancing in knowledge each
year. The school is well classified. Had
an exhibition at close. Did not spend
much time on it, but had them learn their
parts well. Several white visitors attended
it. One of the gentlemen talked well to
the people on morals. He went around
and told the people I was very smart. I
was told another one said I could read and
write better than any white woman in the
county.”</p>

<p>Another girl said: “The white people
did not want teachers from Atlanta, because
they took the money out of the
county. They kept me, however, and
wanted the people to watch me. When I
closed they urged me to stay till Christmas.”</p>

<p>One of our youngest teachers said: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
reached the place in which I was to teach
on ‘Big Meeting’ day, and the people were
very angry to see me, for a daughter of
the most prominent colored man of the
place had been teaching there some years,
and wished to continue. She was very
incompetent, and the Commissioner had
sent for me. The father electioneered for
his daughter at the ‘big meeting,’ told
them she would wait on them for their
pay; she would be there if there was but
one scholar; she’d always look after her
chickens, etc.; but the Commissioner said
to them: ‘This young man can write the
best hand in the county, and you’d better
take him.’ So, after offering to teach for a
very little from the patrons, I got the
school. A white man had given the people
some land if they would build a
church. They did so, but used it during
the week for school. This made the donor
of the land angry, as he did not wish them
to have a school. The year before he and
his wife went to the building, drove off the
teacher, and then he nailed up the door on the
inside, while his wife stood on guard with
his gun. This summer, when my school
was nearly through, the building was
burned. It was very plain who did it. So,
for the little while, we all went to a cotton-gin
house. We laid some shingles down
for a floor, and hauled some logs in for
seats. A paper laid over the gin served for
my desk. We had our closing exercises
under a bush arbor. One day I asked the
children, ‘How many drink whiskey?’
Twenty or thirty held up their hands and said
‘pa and ma drink it, and give it to me.’”</p>

<p>Another says: “I see great improvement
in old people and children. Good
many own land and are still buying. One
man owns two hundred acres. Another
bought some land for eight hundred dollars,
and paid half last year, and is in a fair way
to pay the rest this year. I did not ask a
boy or girl to quit whiskey or tobacco, but
I preached temperance by example and
quiet conversation. There is harmony between
the races. They visit each other’s
churches. The bell of a white church tolled
for a colored woman. This year I had my
first exhibition, because I thought they
better learn to read and write first, then
exhibit after they had something to show.
Prepared the children after school. All
the white people attended.”</p>

<p>Another said: “The morals of the people
are fearful. They don’t expect teachers to
teach morality. Every example set before
our people is one that has been contaminated
by slavery. If I see any one making
for this place I feel something will be done
for him. Every Atlanta student I see, I
feel, ‘There goes one that will liberate our
people from the monster, Immorality.’
Asked the barkeeper if he sold much to
ministers and church members. He replied,
‘Most who buy are church members.’
Then he said, ‘Do you see that
man with a big locket on his watch chain?
He owes me six dollars for whiskey.’ He
was the prominent minister of the place.
Still there is much progress in temperance.
There is an increasing kindly feeling between
the rich and poor. I heard the
editor of the Macon <cite>Telegraph</cite> talk to the
colored people. He said the Atlanta University
was doing more for the State than
the white State University at Athens, and
that the recitations were better.”</p>

<p>Another, whose health would not allow
him to teach, and who stayed here at the
Home to work on the farm, said: “Above
all, we want God with us all the time, from
this day on. Once, during the summer, I
had for a moment such a conception of
God, that I felt if it continued five minutes
I could not live.” These words fell
upon my ears like the experiences of a Finney,
because they were from one who has
no patience with “dream religion,” and
whose godly life here for six years has been
a constant inspiration to us.</p>

<p>Another said: “People are roused to
the subject of education. Children complain
if kept at home. The people can buy
land easily. Treated well by white men.
Most of the whiskey drunk is by white
people. Every man in the county knows
of Atlanta University. At the closing exercises,
a man begged all to save money
enough to go up to the College Commencement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
He’d been once, and should go
next year, if he had to walk.”</p>

<p>All told of the Sunday-school work;
some gave experiences in begging money,
hauling lumber, and putting up school and
church buildings, and most closed by saying,
“I hope I did some good.” One
sweet girl said it in this way: “I left the
results with the Great Reaper, hoping in
due time He will gather His sheaves.”</p>

<p>These reports help much in removing
prejudices and narrow, one-sided views of
the South. While one sees the people
retrograding and the whites overbearing,
another has a bright view on the other
side.</p>

<p>This great number and variety of yearly
reports impress us most, however, with
the magnitude of our work, and the great
need we have of your prayers, that this
may be a pure fountain whom whence
healing streams only shall flow.</p>

<h3>TENNESSEE.</h3>

<h4>Woman’s Work Among Women.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MISS HATTIE MILTON, MEMPHIS.</p>


<p>Out of a population of 40,000, one-third
are colored. Many of the children attend
school a few months during the year; but
the parents think if their son John Quincy
Adams Anderson attends school two weeks
out of four, he will “learn a heap,” and be
ready to graduate in a year or two. However,
some of the children do make good
progress at school; but the home influence
is so degrading that the necessity of missionary
work among the mothers is felt
more and more, as we see more of their
homes. Many are too poor to send their
children to school at all; consequently they
have no opportunity of becoming better.</p>

<p>In my daily visits from house to house I
found them in a wretched condition, filth
and vermin reigning supreme. Often, on
entering these abodes, my sensibilities were
so shocked that I could not speak at first—dogs,
cats, chickens and children clamoring
for the hoe cake in the ashes or the unleavened
dough baking on the stove-cover,
which, when done, is broken and handed
around to each, sometimes with the addition
of a dripping bit of bacon. In many of
these homes the table is never set, the entire
furniture consisting of a bed, two
chairs, a trunk, box, cupboard, bundle of
rags and a poor stove, if there is no fireplace.
They sometimes own the board
shanties in which they live, and rent the
ground they stand on; and when they wish
to move, they pull down the shanty, move it
to the new place, and put it up again.</p>

<p>I was usually received kindly; by some
enthusiastically. One old ex-slave, learning
the nature of my errand at her house, said,
raising her hands above her turbaned head,
“Oh, bless the Lord! Thank the Lord! for
He has heard the prayer of His downtrodden
people, and put it into the hearts
of His dear children in the North to send
some one to instruct us. My blessed baby,
come as often as you can, and read to Aunt
Hettie, for she is an ole Etheopum, and
don’t know nothing.” After I left, she
rushed around to her neighbors, saying,
“Bless the Lord! for He has heard our
prayer, and sent an angel right down from
heaven to instruct us, and she has been to
my house this evenin’.” They were usually
glad—many were anxious—to hear the Bible
read, some insisting on paying me, saying,
“Do take it. We wants you to come often,
for we don’t hear anything like it anywhere
else.” One woman, wishing, as she said, to
do something for the Lord, and having no
money, sent me a nice warm dinner. They
are very liberal, giving as long as they have
a nickel, whether they rightly own it or not.</p>

<p>Some who were suspicious said, “Never
heerd tell of white lady going to humble
colo’d cabin to read the Bible. Look like
it’s mighty queer.” These suspicions had
to be overcome in various ways. Often, by
attending the sick ones, the good will of the
neighbors would be secured. One poor
creature, who had not been washed in six
months, and was almost dead, after I had
bathed her and put on her clean clothes—furnished
by the good Northern friends—thanked
me and said, “Thank the Lord!
when we get home to heaven, we will all
have on clean clothes.” Her last days of
suffering were thus made more comfortable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
I went in often, as she loved to hear the
Bible read, and singing. But a few weeks
later, I went in one morning, and found her
poor remains stretched out on a rough
board, resting on two chairs. Thus she lay
in state, in her winding-sheet. A plate,
placed on her crossed hands, with its mute
appeal for money to bury her, told how poor
they were.</p>

<p>One day a very black woman met me on
the street and said, “How d’y’, Miss. You
don’t know me; but I knows you, for you is
the one what visits the sick; and I heard
you read the Bible, and I wants ye to read
it to me. We all loves ye, and we all says,
‘If any one is gwine right up to heaven, it
is you.’” I often found the best way to
reach the mother was through her children.
By giving them little presents, they would
become fond of me. Then the mother, who
was proud of them, would say, “I wants
my children to be better than me, but don’t
know how to make them so. I whips them
a heap, but they is bad all the time.” After
convincing one mother that she was teaching
her children to lie by her daily example,
she said, “Sure enough! Never thought
of that afore. I alus wondered why my
children would lie so, ’cause I alus tells ’em
not to. Now, Miss, you come often, and
teach me; I needs it much as any one. How
can we be expected to do better? No one
we go with does any better; and in ole
slave times, if master saw us with a book,
he would ‘slap our jaws;’ so we cannot
read to find out better.” Another said,
“This is the first work I have seen that
looked like really making our homes better.”</p>

<p>Finding the mothers and daughters knew
but little about sewing, an industrial school
was started, where they met once a week,
and were taught how to cut, fit and make
garments. The material for this school was
furnished by the good people of Romeo. A
small sum was charged for each garment,
when finished, and used to purchase more
material. Also a small price was charged
for a few of the more valuable garments sent
in boxes, the persons gladly paying the
small sum, which was used to procure medicine
and other comforts for the sick ones.</p>

<p>I also added something to this fund by giving
lessons to some who were able and willing
to pay for the instruction.</p>

<p>Sunday was my most busy day; besides
attending church and Sabbath-school, I
went out to read the Bible to those who
were not at home during the week. I
seemed to find no rest days; indeed, there
was so much for one pair of hands to do,
that many times I could not sleep as much
as needed. Another meeting was held
weekly. I gave Bible readings on those
subjects which were of the most interest
and importance to mothers, after which we
had a prayer-meeting, which was often
very interesting.</p>

<p>Near the end of the year, a temperance
movement was started in our church and
Sabbath-school; many signed the pledge,
among whom were about thirty from my
class. The colored people are very intemperate,
and nearly all the women use snuff
and tobacco. One, who was complaining of
her poverty, upon being told she could ill
afford to use snuff and tobacco, said she
only paid ten cents a box, and was astonished
to find that in a year it amounted to
half as much as her rent. She seemed to
try to live an honest Christian life, and before
I left had given up all her bad habits,
and was very proud and happy.</p>

<p>Although these people are naturally religious,
still their religion consists in going
to meeting, where they sing, pray, and relate
imaginary experiences, and get
wrought up to such a pitch that they
scream, roll on the floor, and often remain
until the small hours of the night. They
go home, thinking they are very holy, but
have no idea of showing it by a well-ordered
life; on the contrary, they continue to live
with unlawful companions, steal and lie
with impunity; in fact, in many respects,
they will compare with their heathen forefathers,
from whom they have inherited
their superstitions and forms of worship.
The bonds of slavery have prevented them
from becoming enlightened.</p>

<p>However, I am glad to say there are
some grand exceptions to this dark picture;
some noble Christians, a few who have good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
homes. Among these, the good accomplished
by the mission-school and the little
Congregational church, sustained by the
A. M. A., can be seen. The pastor, Mr.
Mallory, allows no wife whipping in his
church, and he has caused the large number
of those who were living together unlawfully
to be married. Indeed, his church
will compare favorably with white churches
of the North. These things show the
dawning of day to these benighted people,
and give us great encouragement to proceed
with our work. But the mass are
worse than tongue can tell or pen portray.
I feel that in my description the half of
woe and degradation has not been told.
The Lord was with me in this work, and
was a present help in every time of need.
Many mornings I would start out with a
heavy heart, for it would seem that my
efforts to do good were almost in vain; but
trusting alone in Jesus, I would go forward.
Just then the Lord would show me that
some one was becoming better, and I would
return at evening upbraiding myself for my
want of faith, and reminded of that Scripture
which says, “He that goeth forth,
and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing
his sheaves with him.” It was a precious
privilege to comfort these broken-hearted
ones with His words, of whom it
was said: “Never man spake like this
Man.”</p>

<p>The Bible is the only book the colored
people have any confidence in. A sick
man, whom I visited, said he would like to
hear the Bible read through; he was not a
Christian. For some time he seemed but
little interested; but one day he greeted
me with a smile, saying: “I can trust the
Lord now, and it is all that Bible-reading.
Many have talked to me before, but I
never thought of what they said; but I
could not forget these words from the
Bible, and I studied about it all the time,
and last week, after you left me, I just did
as the Bible said: gave up all, and trusted
Jesus. I am ready to go now, and am not
afraid.”</p>

<p>When the time drew near for me to
return North, the women said: “What
will we do without you? Who will visit
us when sick, and read comforting words
from the Bible? And who will teach us
how to train up our children? Now that
we have had some one to do these things
for us, we feel as if we could not get along
without you.” And many were the expressions
of gratitude towards those dear
ladies in the North, who had sent them a
missionary, and many the prayers offered
in their behalf. There were many signs of
encouragement, though, no doubt, much
seed that was sown will not spring up at
once, but in the future will bear precious
fruit, for the Lord will not permit His
word to return unto Him void. This has
been the happiest year of my life, for this
work has its own reward, both to the missionary
and those who send her, which is
more valuable than silver or gold. I sometimes
think the angels might almost envy
us in this work.</p>

<h3>NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<h4>Students Want to “Batch”—Who Will Help?</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. ALFRED CONNETT, McLEANSVILLE.</p>


<p>We hear almost daily of young men and
young women who would come here to
school if they could only get a room where
they could “batch.” I can only hear of
one vacant house within two miles of the
school, and that is engaged by two students
who have not yet returned. Small
buildings, say 12×20, one story, two rooms,
can be built for about $100 each, and land
bought at $6 to $10 per acre, possibly $20
for small tracts. By making some provision
of this kind to accommodate students,
we should at once draw in ten to
twenty students, and these the very ones
we most need to reach: namely, those
who are preparing to teach, and to preach.
Thus, the school would become more widely
and more permanently useful. These
buildings are needed immediately, or part
of them. It is difficult, if not impossible,
with their limited means, for the students to
obtain board, with suitable accommodations.
The white people do not wish to
take in boarders, unless at high figures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
and the colored people have, usually, but
one room in their log houses.</p>

<p>Cannot some church, individual, or individuals,
do a work for Christ in this way?
If this, or something similar is not done,
we shall let an important and precious
opportunity slip through our fingers.</p>

<h3>TALLADEGA, ALABAMA.</h3>

<h4>The Story of Ambrose Headen,</h4>

<p class="secauth">AS TOLD BY HIMSELF.</p>


<p>I am fifty-six years old; was born in
Chatham Co., N. C.; was a slave forty-three
years, sixteen years in North Carolina
and twenty seven in Alabama. I
have lived in this county forty years. My
young master in North Carolina was four
years older than myself; he had nine slaves,
and I was the only male. He died just
before I was sixteen. When I was thirteen
I went to learn the carpenter’s trade. I was
taken from my mother and sent away to
nurse children when I was six. I served
three years at the carpenter’s bench and at
that time my master died, and I had to be
sold to pay his debts.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the sale I went
fourteen miles on foot, and alone, to the
place where I was to be sold. On my way
I tried to lay some plan to run away. A
white woman said she would help me, and
told me to go into a certain swamp and
she would feed me and help me away, but
I was afraid of the dogs and the men that
would catch me. No one can tell my feelings
on my way to the sale, but I knew I
had to go. At the place of sale were 500
people come together to see me sold, and to
buy me. I was the only one to be
sold. I was on the block three hours
while the men were bidding for me. Five
of these men were speculators, and the rest
were mostly people that lived in that region.
While they were selling me there
was a good deal of brandy drunk, and they
offered me some as I was very tired standing;
and I said, “No, sir, I have sorrow
enough on me now without drinking that.”
I was finally knocked off to a very bad man
for $1,780. This man lived about thirteen
miles from my old home, and when I knew
that he was my master I burst into tears,
heart-broken. The overseer took me behind
the store and tried to stop me from crying,
but I could not stop. At last, my new
master said if any one would give for me as
much as he had, he might have me, and a
man from Alabama, who was out to North
Carolina on a visit, said he would, and so I
sold again to this man from Alabama,
and after three months I was taken away
from all my friends away down to Alabama.
My new master proved to be a good man,
a member of the Baptist Church, and I
lived with him twenty-seven years until
emancipation. One thing I forgot to tell
you, and it made a deep impression on my
mind: at the time I was being sold in
North Carolina, a man in the crowd cried
out with a loud voice, “Hell will boil and
overflow at such work as this.” I never can
forget that expression.</p>

<p>I was set free by two wills; the first one
was burned, and so I was kept in slavery.
Once, after I had been absent from home
some time, my mistress, on my return,
came rushing out to the gate and crying
with a loud voice, “Oh, Ambrose, Ambrose!
I had rather live in the smokiest
cabin on the place, and had your master’s
will done, than to be in the king’s palace,”
but the will was burned and so it could not
be done. The other will that set me free was
made ten years before emancipation; but
emancipation came before my master died,
and so his will did me no good.</p>

<p>During all my slave life I never lost sight
of freedom. It was always on my heart; it
came to me like a solemn thought, and often
circumstances much stimulated the desire to
be free and raised great expectation of it.
We slaves all knew when an Abolitionist
got into Congress. We knew it when
there was just one there, and we watched
it all the way until there was a majority
there. I don’t know hardly how we got
the knowledge, but we always knew. We
always called “freedom” “possum,” so as
to keep the white people from knowing
what we were talking about. We all understood
it.</p>

<p>Some years before emancipation, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
master signed $900 to be paid in work
towards building a Baptist College where
we lived. He sent me to work out his
subscription. I had four children of my
own, and I thought that it was hard for
me to work out this $900, when I could
have no privilege of educating my own
children. I little thought then that my
children would ever graduate at this college,
but God has turned things about so
that three of my children have graduated,
and the fourth will graduate next June;
so that when I worked out this subscription
of my master, I was building a college for
myself and my family. While at work on
this college, I fell into a conversation with
the white carpenters at work there, and
they said “niggers” would do nothing “if
set free.” I told them if they would take
me out into the woods and strip every rag
from me, and set me free, that in ten
years I would school my children.</p>

<p>Just after emancipation my master said:
“Ambrose, I want you to let Nannie stay
with her mistress; she can’t do without
her.” I said: “Master, I always thought
that if ever I was free I would educate my
children; if ’twas not for that, sir, I would
accommodate you.” “Ambrose,” said he,
“I hardly thought you would deny me.”
I said: “I can’t do any better, sir.”
With this we separated, and now all my
children are good scholars; one is a minister;
one has charge of an academy; I have
a good house of seven rooms, and eleven
acres of land about it, besides a farm of
320 acres in the country.</p>

<p>Nothing can illustrate the great change
that has come over us, unless it is the change
in passing from earth to heaven. You
could see the force of this illustration if
you knew our history—if you only knew
the dark Egypt we have come through. I
believe emancipation will work out as great
things for us as it did for Israel.</p>

<p>When the college and the Congregational
Church were planted here I joined
the church, and have never been sorry for it.
I love the missionary cause, and would rather
give all I have than to see it go down.</p>

<p>I love to think of my son down in Selma
preaching. There was quite a scare there
about the yellow fever, and my son wrote
me to know what he should do; I wrote
him back, “to look to the Lord, and stand
to his post.”</p>

<h3>THE MENDI MISSION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. A. F. JACKSON, AVERY.</p>


<p>When one enters upon this kind of work,
he enters upon a tedious and arduous one—a
work accompanied with many dark and
gloomy days, as well as some bright ones.
I suppose that you are aware that my
work has been assigned me at Avery, or
Mannah Bargroo Station, on the Little
Sherbro river, about fifty-eight miles from
Good Hope. At this station all of the
agricultural work is carried on. We have
here a mill, coffee-farm and ginger farm.
I employ in the mill seven native men all
the while; and on the farm two native
men; besides a crew of boatmen, that row
our boat from British Sherbro to the neighboring
villages to sell the lumber that is
sawed at our mill. We are enabled to
keep one boat running all the while, and
it is manned by natives entirely. They
make first-rate crewmen, and have a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
advantage over a similar act of Englishmen
or Americans, from the fact that
they are always naked, and there is no impediment
in case of an accident. All of
them can swim in almost any kind of
water. They do not stop to question whether
there be alligators in the water or not,
but go at the command. I can say that I
have tried them sufficiently in all ways,
and I have as yet found them all to
be quite honest, with the exception of one
man, who very politely went into my lot of
goods on the way from Good Hope to my
station, and took therefrom five or six
yards of baft to trade for rice. This is the
only dishonest act that I have known any
one to commit since my arrival on the
coast of Africa.</p>

<p>I have said a good deal about my boatmen,
and will now give you a brief sketch of
the habits and customs of this people. In the
first place, the men go entirely naked, with
the exception of a cloth they wear, something
like that of an American baby’s
diaper. The women wear about four yards
of cloth thrown carelessly around them,
covering the lower extremities, and tied
by the ends about the waist.</p>

<p>When one dies, they have what they call
“the cry,” in which all join. They go for
miles to attend “the cry.” The body of
the deceased is wrapped in matting, and
conveyed to its long resting-place—a hole
which is dug for that purpose. This has
always been their mode of burying, and in
many instances they prefer it to our way.</p>

<p>As to the general build of this people it
is quite good. They possess very good
features, as a general thing, having
smooth skins and round faces. Their noses
are not so flat as the American negro’s;
neither are their eyes so red and blood-shot.
Their mouths are not so disfigured.
The most of them have quite a neat lip,
not so thick as that of the American
negro. Their hands and feet are generally
small. Their bodies are very straight and
well developed. It is astonishing to see
how they carry burdens, either upon the
head or back, with a loop so that it can
be fastened around their foreheads.</p>

<p>A good stout man will carry as much on
his head and back as you can pack on a
young ass three years old, and they never
murmur. They live in mud houses covered
with thatch, but a thatch inferior to anything
we know of in America. It is made
of bamboo, and only lasts from nine to
twelve months.</p>

<p>They subsist on rice, cassada, cocoa, fufu,
crencray, palaver-sauce and fish. Any one
of these vegetables mentioned will grow
without any attention at all, except the
cocoa, and that is a very tender plant,
indeed, and the consequence is, that they
have less of it than anything else. The
cocoa and cassada are the only vegetables
that I have learned to eat. The cocoa,
after it is cooked, is much like an
Irish potato, and makes a very palatable
dish, indeed. The cassada, when cooked,
resembles an American squash, and is
a very nice dish for dinner or breakfast.
Should a person presume to eat these vegetables
mentioned, without having been a
good while in the country, he at once had
better have a mill-stone hanged about his
neck, and his body committed to the briny
deep. He would fare about as well. No
foreigner, of whatever nationality he may
be, can come into Africa and subsist at
first upon the native productions.</p>

<p>We are all aware that Africa has long
been called the burying-ground of missionaries.
The reasons are, in my judgment,
these: In the first place, missionaries in
going to Africa generally exert themselves
too much on entering the field. The climate
is such as rapidly to reduce one’s physical
strength. It is a custom among all persons,
as soon as they have been informed of
their malady, at once to retire to their beds,
and demand that a physician be called.
The calling of the physician is all right;
but it is far better to keep out of bed, and
to keep moving; for if you give up and
go to bed, you are almost sure to die.
Another reason, as I before said, is trying
to live on native productions too early
after arriving on the continent.</p>

<p>I must say, just here, that two-thirds of
what you hear about Africa is fabulous. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
least it is so in the region in which our
missions are established. There is a great
deal said about the native bread-tree.
There is such a thing as a bread-tree in this
country, but it is almost as scarce in
the region in which the mission is established
as the orange-tree is in the States,
and you are aware how plentiful the orange-tree
is there. The fabulous tree so called,
might very appropriately have been named
a squash-tree, because it bears no similarity
to bread, and will not answer at all in
the place of bread. When green, or before
it is plucked, it bears a close similarity
to what is known in the States as the hedge
orange, and, when cooked, it tastes something
between a potato-pumpkin and squash.</p>

<p>There are some oranges here, but they
are scarce. They do not seem to be a
native fruit, because they do not grow everywhere
in the country, but only where the
ground is cleared up, and the undergrowth
cut down. They are not of a rich yellow
color like an American orange, but greenish
and small. They have quite a delicious taste,
somewhat devoid of juice, when compared
with our Florida orange, but equal to it in
sweetness. We have another fruit here,
known as the lime. It bears a close similarity
to a lemon; in fact the only difference
that I can detect is, that the
lemon as a general thing is larger, and not
so round. As to the pine-apple, it grows only
where it is taken care of; it may grow in
the wilds, but never bears fruit. The rice
that is grown in Africa is not so good as
that in the States. It is really the
main thing grown upon the continent in
the way of eatables. If you buy two
bushels of rough rice, you will not get
more than sixteen quarts that can be used,
and you must pay from 2s. 9d. to 3s. per
bushel. This, I am sorry to say, is about
the way with all the country productions.</p>

<p>Knowing that you are always anxious
concerning our health, I, perhaps, ought to
have spoken of it sooner. I am in quite good
health, and have been since my first attack
of the African fever. My wife has had
quite a severe attack of the fever; so
severe that I thought I should lose her;
but God in his goodness saw fit to spare
her to me. She has never regained
her strength, but I trust that God in some
way or other will restore her to perfect
health again.</p>

<p>The religious work at Avery is going on
nicely. I found here a small chapel, but
no church members. Dr. James had kept
up a prayer-meeting, and there was some
interest among the people, but there had
been no ingathering of souls to Christ.
After looking around and seeing the real
condition of things, I came to the conclusion
that whatever was done must be done
quickly; so I made it my aim to get at the
people at once with the truths of Jesus
Christ, and they seemed to take right hold
of them as fast as given to them. I
adopted this plan: to take my Bible every
evening and go out among the regular
heathen; but I soon found out that I was
unable to reach them in that way, from the
fact that I could not speak their language.
So I gave that plan up, and adopted the
one of going among them twice a week,
and taking with me my Bible and an interpretor.
This I found to be the best plan;
so then and there I got hold of the people.
Now, having found this to work well,
I began to preach to the people in their
own villages and “fackies,” as they call
them. After I found out that I could
gather them together in their fackies, I
then set to work to persuade them to come
to my church; which I did with great success,
and from time to time I gathered into
the church the following persons and names.
June 16th, I opened the doors of the
church, and enrolled the following: H.
C. Hallock L., Isaac Vincent L., James
Cole L., John Davis R., Samuel Wise R.,
Richard Wilkerson R., Yamba R., One
Pound R., Henry Peters R., Small Banna
R., William Wilberforce L., Mrs. Lucker
L., Mrs. Peters R., Mrs. Hannah Vincent
L., and a Sherbro chief, A. P. Cardy R.</p>

<p>June 30th, I opened the doors of the
church again, and enrolled the following:
James Picket L., Sarah Tucker R., Mrs.
Elizabeth Beal R., Elizabeth Wilberforce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
R., Mrs. Mary Cole L., Mrs. Nancy Davis
R., Madam Damba R., Madam Dambee R.
July 28th, I opened the doors and took the
following names. The chief Karry Pherner
L., chief, Lalula R., John Bull R.,
Cunda R., Kirby R., Matilda Leatum L.,
Mrs. Yamba R., Mrs. One Pound R., and
Bye R. As I neglected to tell you in regard
to the conversion of these persons I
will give you some idea of it by the following
letters. The letter “R” signifies recently
converted, and the letter “L” long converted.
I must say that the especial blessing
of the Lord seemed very near all on the 4th
of August. This was the first Lord’s Supper
celebrated at Avery Station. On this
day I preached to a very large number of
native men and women. I baptized seven
grown persons and four children, making a
total of eleven persons baptized.</p>

<p>This people, as a general thing, have
very many troubles among themselves that
must be settled at once, in order to secure
peace among them. If you have gained
their confidence, they will at all times
call upon you to settle any disturbance
that may occur among them, it matters
not how difficult the case may be. Great
caution is required in rendering your
decision, otherwise it may cause speedy
bloodshed and panic throughout the
region. I am sorry to say that the
prospects are quite threatening just
now for an outbreak at any time
in the region adjacent to Avery and the
Little Boom. But I hope that it will not
be very serious. The Governor is expected
to investigate the Boom trouble this week,
and it is thought that it can be settled
without any serious damage to either side.
I have felt greatly the lack of reading matter
at my Station. There are many dreary
hours out here that might be whiled away
with good reading matter. I rather think
that some of the good friends in New York
would be glad to send a paper or two now
and then to a poor wayfarer on the distant
shores of Africa.</p>

<h2>THE INDIANS.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>SISSETON AGENCY.</h3>

<h4>Farming Tools Bought.</h4>

<p class="secauth">E. H. C. HOOPER, AGENT</p>

<p>For several years past, till last year, the
crops on this reserve have been nearly all
destroyed by grasshoppers; but this season
promises an abundant harvest. The farming
has been attended with unusual success,
and the Indians feel very much encouraged
with the result of their farm labor.</p>

<p>At present there are 2,191 acres of
land broken on this reservation, 450 acres
of which are new land broken during this
season. Seventeen hundred acres are under
cultivation by the Indians. There was a
much larger acreage plowed last fall than
ever before at the same season of the year,
and, under the supervision of our farmer, it
was well prepared for seeding in the spring.
Nearly all our Indians, who were without
seed, were provided from the warehouse
early in the season, and manifested a good
degree of interest in planting and cultivating.</p>

<p>Early in July, many of the Indian
farmers, feeling confident of a large yield
of grain, were very earnest in their appeals
for grain cradles and other appliances with
which to secure their crops. And, under
authority from the Department, a lot of
grain cradles were bought and issued to them.
But the number purchased was insufficient
to supply the wants of all, and a considerable
portion of the wheat in small
fields was cut with scythes.</p>

<p>Several of our Indians who have large
wheat fields, have bought harvesters for
themselves, at a cost of from $165 to
$200 each, and are to pay for them from
the proceeds of their sales of wheat; this
is a move in the right direction and cannot
be too highly commended.</p>

<p>All our Indians are half-breeds (with
but few exceptions, and these generally
confined to very old people) wear citizens’
dress, and a large majority of them live in
very comfortable houses, made of hewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
logs, and are furnished with cook-stoves,
tables, seats, and other housekeeping conveniences.</p>

<p>There are some forty frame buildings
occupied by our Indians, several of which
are two stories high and painted, all having
more or less land under cultivation.</p>


<h4>Schools.</h4>

<p>During ten months of the year—(the
Manual Labor School eleven months)—three
schools have been in successful operation:
the Manual Labor School, the
Good-Will Boarding and Day-School, and
the Ascension School. The Manual Labor
School building, situated one and a half
miles from the agency, was originally provided
with seats for fifty-six scholars, but
the sleeping accommodations for this number
of children have never been sufficient, and
during the past year our carpenter has
made an addition of several new sleeping
rooms, and improved the condition of the
old ones, which has added very much to
the comfort and convenience of the pupils.</p>

<p>There are only four or five boys of sufficient
age to be serviceable about the farm
or garden. When out of school they were
kept at work preparing the ground for
seeding and cultivating, besides attending
to the stock and farm work generally, all
being done under the immediate supervision
of the principal, who is, fortunately, a
good farmer.</p>

<p>After the regular school hours, the girls
are taught sewing of all kinds; cutting,
making and trimming dresses, repairing
garments; darning, knitting and use of
sewing machine; also all kinds of housework,
cooking, and the work of the dairy.
After service in the evening, instructions
are given in music, instrumental and vocal,
in which both boys and girls take an
unusual interest and show a marked improvement
during the year. Mr. Tuckey,
the present principal, assumed the duties of
his office May 1st, and has been untiring in
his exertions to advance the pupils in
their studies, and, for the short time which
he has been with them, appears to have
been very successful. The two female assistants
having had two years’ experience
here, and been deeply interested in their
pupils, have proved very valuable and
successful teachers, and have the confidence
and respect of the parents.</p>

<p>The time of the matron is fully occupied
from six A. M. to nine P. M., in looking
after and providing for the numerous wants
of the pupils, and in this difficult and laborious
work has proved to be very efficient.</p>

<p>The Good Will Mission Boarding and
Day-School is situated one and three
quarter miles from the agency; the children
are rationed and supplied in part with
clothing from the warehouse, but the other
expenses—salaries, etc—are borne by the
A. B. C. F. M. This school has accommodated
as many as thirty-two scholars, part
of them boarding at houses in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The day-school, situated at Ascension,
about six miles from the agency, had,
some months, thirty scholars; they live in
the vicinity of the school-house, and are
quite regular in attendance.</p>

<p>In addition to these three schools, two
others were opened, and reading, writing
and arithmetic in Dakota were taught by
Indian teachers, during two months in the
spring, with an average daily attendance
of eighteen scholars each. These
schools were opened at the earnest request
of several of the leading men in their
vicinity, in the form of a petition
to the agent. These parents seemed in
earnest in their efforts to have the schools
opened, and showed a continued interest in
them by frequent visits during the time
they were in operation.</p>

<p>The estimated number of children of
school-going age on this reserve is
three hundred, and we have two brick
school-houses, built in 1873, at an estimated
cost of $600 each—one situated
about one and a half miles south of the
agency, and the other at the Mayasan,
twenty miles distant; both are provided
with improved seats, tables, etc., and
will accommodate forty scholars each;
neither of them has been used, for school
purposes to any extent since they were built,
but allowed to remain unoccupied.</p>

<p class=" center">OF THE</p>

<p class="xxlarge center">1879.</p>


<p>We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing appreciation of
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the year now nearly past; and purpose to spare no effort to
make its pages of still greater value to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1879?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to
induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs, will easily double our list, and thus
widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="smcap">Geo. M. Boynton</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
“<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>” furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going
forward among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="xlarge center"><b>SUBSCRIPTION DEPARTMENT.</b></p>

<p class="medium">Besides giving news from the Institutions and
Churches aided by the Association among the
Freedmen in the South, the Indian tribes, the
Chinese on the Pacific Coast, and the Negroes in
Western Africa, it will be the vehicle of important
views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give a monthly summary
of current events relating to their welfare and
progress.</p>

<p class="medium">We publish <b>25,000</b> copies per month, and shall
be glad to increase the number indefinitely, knowing
from experience that to be informed of our
work is to sympathize with, and desire to aid it.</p>

<p class="medium">The Subscription Price will be, as formerly,
<b>Fifty Cents a Year, in Advance</b>. We also
offer to send <b>One Hundred copies to one
address</b>, for distribution in Churches or to clubs
of subscribers, for $30., with the added privilege of
a Life Membership to such person as shall be designated.
The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if
preferred, to the persons indicated on Page 318.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
